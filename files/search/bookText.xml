                                                        Message



                                  First of all, I wholeheartedly commend this academic initiated
                                  by two young scholars who happen to be the permanent
                                  faculties belonging to the SKBU family for showcasing of
                                  diverse perspectives and overall documentation of knowledge
                                  cultivation and data mobilization efforts during the difficult
                                  period of the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. Of late, we
                                  have resumed work in the post-pandemic scenario, yet
                                  uncertainty is looming large due to the spectrum of instability
                                  and the possibility of Covid returning back under the guise of
                                  a new lethal Ba2 variant that is causing huge surge in the
                                  ASEAN countries and in Western Europe. Placed in this
                                  backdrop of precarious circumstances that directly impact and
                                  impinge upon human security and has triggered likelihood to
                                  affect our education system and professions, I think it is of
                                  great importance to collect insights out of our valuable
                                  experience and knowledge sharing. Here lies the raison d’être
                                  of this initiative to put on record our work as academicians
                                  during the pandemic induced new normal. I am sanguine that
                                  showcasing the past effort in the form of the present volume
                                  will certainly be useful to boost up our ceaseless journey to
                                  future and thus create a positive fillip of inspiration to the
                                  community and policy makers at large.
                                    We have just stepped into the post-pandemic phase albeit
                                  with a more cautious approach so that we can build up our
                                  future with safeguards. It needs the zest to learn from our
                                  collective struggle to enrich our future roadmap with resilience

                                                                                      9]]></page><page Index="11"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  and gumption. So, teaching-learning and research during the
                                  pandemic have lot to offer in undertaking a comprehensive
                                  approach not only to discern the areas of contingent changes,
                                  but also to ponder over and devise suitable reforms in order to
                                  impart a sustainable, dynamic and holistic orientation to the
                                  knowledge ecosystem at large. However, it is not possible
                                  without steering our course through myriad perspectives and
                                  constructive debate in civil society and academia combined.
                                  And I am glad to learn and recognise that many members of
                                  academic community, particularly my colleagues of Sidho-
                                  Kanho-Birsha University worked hard not only to carry forward
                                  their own research but they also went beyond mere pedagogical
                                  aspects for upholding social interest during the severely crisis-
                                  ridden period of the pandemic.
                                     It is a matter of great pleasure to note that Professor Gouri
                                  Sankar Nag and Dr. Laxmiram Gope have taken up this book
                                  project to weave together more than thirty well-written pieces
                                  with the intent to put on record the efforts of the teachers,
                                  researchers and academic administrators and planners, who
                                  carried the mantle forward with tremendous spirit to render
                                  service during the most trying hours for opening up the
                                  opportunities to train and educate the youth through diverse
                                  modes despite the challenges of digital divide. As such, this
                                  book represents a unique scholarship which touches upon
                                  different dimensions of our enterprise that we already devised
                                  and even what we could not do but what we ought to have done
                                  during the pandemic induced crisis. Therefore, I acknowledge
                                  that this volume represents a comprehensive epistemology not
                                  only in sync with the emergency needs when imposition of
                                  lockdown disrupted the face-to-face interaction of the classroom
                                  and online mode had to be introduced overnight, but the
                                  content of the book also goes beyond that shift, to catalyse to
                                  think of future strategies /research road map, one which would
                                  be equally useful for the larger public to inch forward toward
                                  optimum solution to the future problems. In the overall design
                                  of the book the editors have been sagacious to incorporate even

                                  the framework of the S.D.G goals on which we think that the
                                  2030 agenda can only be achieved through intra-societal and
                                  extra-societal alliance, solidarity, collaboration and trust. There
                                  is a proverb ‘if you want to go first, go alone, but if you want
                                  to go far, go together’. I think this book really holds out such
                                  a future path of knowledge transformation and what transpires
                                  from the articles assembled here is not only a pan-Indian vision
                                  from Punjab to Tripura and Tamil Nadu to Bengal but taken
                                  together the compilation seems to become a cogent confluence
                                  of ideas to equip us with relevant inputs to design new
                                  methodologies of learning in the fast evolving global scenario.

                                                       MESSAGE


                                  Information and Communication Technology has influenced all
                                  the spheres of human life to great extent. It was emerged as one
                                  of the best medium to continue education across the school and
                                  university levels during Covid-19. The National Education
                                  Policy (NEP) 2020 has emphasized on the online teaching,
                                  learning, assessment and research at all levels of education in
                                  India. But there is scarcity of books and researches on online
                                  education in India. Hence, need of the hour is to develop
                                  resources for teachers, students and researchers so that the
                                  potentialities of online education can be fully harnessed and
                                  purpose of NEP 2020 can be realized. In this context, book on
                                  “Online Learning and Research: Alternative Dimensions of
                                  Knowledge Cultivation during Covid-19 Pandemic” is very
                                  relevant and time worthy.

                                    The book contains total 32 chapters including conceptual
                                  and research based papers. The important chapters are based on
                                  various element of online education and research such as
                                  flipped learning, blended learning, machine learning, changing
                                  concept of online learning, issues and challenges in online
                                  learning, online education during Covid-19, online education
                                  and psychological impacts on students, technology for teaching
                                  specific subjects, initiatives and innovations of Govt. for
                                  education during Covid-19 and researches on different segments
                                  of online learning in local context etc.
                                    It gives me immense pleasure to write forward for this
                                  valuable book which can help practitioners,  researchers as well
                                  as educational administrators to understand and implement
                                  different complex aspects of online education and research.

                                                                                      13]]></page><page Index="15"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  The strength of the book is that chapters are contributed by
                                  faculty members and researchers working in different higher
                                  education institutes across India. The chapters are very well
                                  written and edited, properly organized and sequenced with
                                  appropriate illustrations, citations and references. I congratulate
                                  and appreciate both Prof. Gouri Sankar Nag and Dr. Laxmiram
                                  Gope, the editors for their meticulous work of editing and
                                  brining the chapters in book form. I also congratulate all the
                                  respected contributors for their innovative and organized work
                                  of global level. I hope the book will illuminate and motivate
                                  scholars and practitioners to implement online education in
                                  their professional field and pursue good quality researches to
                                  develop innovative pedagogical tools.

                                       Introduction and Acknowledgement



                                  We are delighted to present a comprehensive and authoritative
                                  volume on innovative teaching-learning and research with
                                  diversified perspectives of authors and teachers affiliated to
                                  different higher educational institutions throughout the length
                                  and breadth of India. Although we are living in a post-print era
                                  in which e-Book and e-compositions are healthier and more
                                  trendy as well as more preferable to the young researchers
                                  around the world yet we planned to bring out this compendium
                                  in a hardbound form primarily in keeping with the urgent need
                                  to reach out to the remote audience where internet access
                                  remains a teething problem. Hence this pertinent issue which is
                                  not merely technological in nature but of considerable socio-
                                  economic importance has been sought to be taken into account.
                                    This book project emanated from our intellectual enterprise
                                  and sensitivity to address the massive and mammoth challenge
                                  thrown up in the form of Covid-19 Pandemic in 2020-21. In
                                  fact at the initial stage our attention was primarily drawn to the
                                  most immediate aspects like healthcare rather than “alarming
                                  educational deficits” caused by continuous closure of all
                                  educational institutions that persisted for as much a protracted
                                  and lengthy span of 20 months. During this period from
                                  primary to high school, from college to university and research
                                  institutes across the world—all seminaries had to be shut down

                                  outset, it was not a cakewalk. But necessity is the mother of
                                  invention. Thus a host of academic thought leaders started to
                                  ponder over and this serious brainstorming exercise for path
                                  finding could be perceived to bring about necessary breakthrough
                                  amid the deep water of crisis-ridden conditions so that the
                                  urgency to make teaching-learning more broad-based and suitably
                                  designed to address the emergent needs to be accessed by
                                  different categories of pupils placed in different regions could
                                  be reached and supported through knowledge dissemination
                                  under special initiatives. This has given birth to a new model
                                  in which we have witnessed how engagement in the domestic
                                  realm and simultaneously learning from home through distant
                                  mode required efficient management, continuous adjustment
                                  and even doing tasks under new milieu of restricted mobility.
                                  So while on one hand, the veritable key to this entire initiative
                                  was the widest possible use of ICT which was already taking
                                  higher education to a new height, learning from home relied
                                  much on psychological support in the absence of physical
                                  presence of peer groups. So, learning under such stressful
                                  conditions obviously required monitoring with care. So cautious
                                  intervention of parents, and even by tutors was very important
                                  to facilitate the process of the curriculum delivery along with
                                  performance mapping of their wards. Here attitudes of parents
                                  and guardians have widely differed. While some consider
                                  learning from home more safe and cost-effective, there are
                                  negative views which raise questions about the efficacy of
                                  substituting traditional offline with distant leaning mode.

                                    However, there is no gainsaying the fact that this time with
                                  the onset of rapid surge of infection curve when normal
                                  functioning of the public institutions in India had to be suspended
                                  through enforced lockdowns, Indian higher education sector
                                  which in terms of enrolment is second only to China (41.8
                                  million) with 35.7 million students currently enrolled in
                                  universities and colleges faced a massive and severe acid test.
                                  The experience that we leant strongly revealed the necessity of
                                  adequate infrastructure of connectivity and basic ICT skills

                                  which can back up e-learning. Today when the HEIs are
                                  reopening amid looming uncertainty due to widespread
                                  apprehension associated with the outbreak of a third wave even
                                  after crossing the threshold of 100 crores of vaccination in
                                  India, it seems like a flicker of hope that this new method of
                                  education delivery could be a panacea to restore confidence
                                  and for building resilient human resource for future. Of course
                                  there are debates as opinions vary on the efficacy of such
                                  modality of learning and substituting face-to-face classes. As it
                                  is evident from a recently published report that startles us with
                                  the revelation that 92 per cent and 82 per cent of the children
                                  have lost foundational abilities in language and mathematics
                                  respectively owing to the Covid-19 related school closure. The
                                  report furthers castigates the departmental initiatives related to
                                  online teaching as “far too inadequate” and it observes that
                                  local community involvement is very crucial to bring the
                                  students back to the premises of educational institutions.
                                    However when the pandemic spread with unprecedented
                                  panic gripping the population at large it would be improper not
                                  to catalogue diverse initiatives ranging from mobile schools
                                  opened by university students at some localities however in a
                                  small way to trying out telephone lines, WhatsApp messages
                                  and other medium to continue learning activities. Even when
                                  these attempts had many limitations the great lesson of the
                                  pandemic highlighted unprecedented importance of learning
                                  through the new paradigm composed of Internet, YouTube,
                                  community radio etc. So, more we operationalise and promote
                                  open access learning, more popular trend it will become with
                                  advantages of drawing inputs from a variety of sources. In this
                                  context we can refer to India’s New Education Policy, 2020
                                  which wisely prescribes to liberate us from the yoke of the old
                                  by imbibing newer ideas like blended mode via “digital pedagogy
                                  and thereby enriching the teaching-learning process with online
                                  resources and collaborations.” Although many of its
                                  recommendations met with critical flakes evoking the need of
                                  deep pondering, there is no gainsaying the fact that in the post-

                                  pandemic scenario we have to adapt to digital medium
                                  increasingly as now during the tremendous heat wave in India
                                  our offline classes had to be replaced with online mode. Of
                                  course, this switch-over is not without hiccups due to digital
                                  divide which in a deeper sense reflects unequal distribution of
                                  resources in our society and this gap has been widened by the
                                  pandemic. So, perhaps it won’t be advisable to implement and
                                  impose online system all of a sudden but we can’t repudiate the
                                  need of a new direction and orientation as a viable alternative
                                  mode of educational transactions. After all, we cannot undermine
                                  the need as much as we can’t also take it for granted because
                                  no knowledge becomes worthy unless its essence and validity
                                  are fruitful to the society at large. So, if we can properly assess
                                  and utilize the post-pandemic situation it would definitely
                                  unlock a new thought, zeal and enthusiasm to surge forward.
                                  So, now it is high time that we reap the advantage of a number
                                  of competitive websites offering free access to their knowledge
                                  portals which by implication can liberate formal learning from
                                  its time, space, and financial constraints.
                                    All these collectively are bound to offer new learning
                                  methodologies and leverage the exchange of new ideas. Together
                                  these can catapult social consensus on curriculum management
                                  and tuning pedagogical capsules accordingly and furthermore
                                  generate trust among all the stakeholders of the broad academic
                                  community. Not only this but also new techniques can create
                                  and lead us to new path finding through critical and constructive
                                  thinking. We are sanguine that our effort, as well as benign
                                  outlook of the experts and contributors would enable us to
                                  consider new creative solution through remodeling our practices
                                  and approaches as well as upskilling ourselves to create a new
                                  line of discussion and deliberation to strike a fine balance
                                  between capacity and necessity. We say so because we
                                  understand and deeply appreciate the challenges of the current
                                  prevailing situation especially in the context of the developing
                                  country where reality is always very difficult and the matrix is

                                  economic attributes and latent discrepancy in the dispersal of
                                  development benefits or relative backwardness. All these may
                                  not support wholesale conversion either in favour of privatization
                                  of education or smooth adoption of online model. Politically
                                  privatization is not feasible also within established pattern of
                                  democratic set up. Hence, we have seen that even in the post-
                                  globalization scenario the government in third world society
                                  has come forward to aid indigent sections to encourage them by
                                  means of certain schemes of transferring benefits like internet
                                  subsidy etc. So without such wholehearted cooperation extended
                                  by government and NGOs, such a switchover to online mode
                                  cannot be a smooth process. We, as teachers and government as
                                  policy makers also have a sacred responsibility to play a crucial
                                  part not only in taking up and popularizing these new techniques
                                  but also to promote this idea which is essential for efficient
                                  functioning in the present information age. So while we promote
                                  more choice-based, informal and flexible approaches to leaning,
                                  we need to monitor the trend and also may need to steer clear
                                  of any lopsided growth when future courses are likely to be
                                  shopped on retail basis from massive knowledge structures.
                                  Otherwise uncritical reliance upon privatization and online
                                  system alone may result in concentration of knowledge resources
                                  in the hands of high-tech corporate houses like Amazon.
                                    This book, however, reflects the objective zeitgeist to re-
                                  orient and reformulate the existing teaching-learning pattern.
                                  Here our approach is neither pre-determined nor mechanical,
                                  rather it is advisable and desirable to keep the options open. We
                                  think that higher academic knowledge cultivation in the future
                                  classroom should be free from any restricted model while it is
                                  purposive to make use of local and traditional knowledge
                                  within broad contours of Indian streams and simultaneously to
                                  utilize advantages implicit in local space to overcome the
                                  existing barriers. So, our approach is not prescriptive, while we
                                  believe that validity and reliability of the online mode would be
                                  decided by society at large rather than been superimposed from
                                  above. So, our approach is to put forward a vibrant, inclusive

                                                                                      19]]></page><page Index="21"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  platforms.
                                    But as we look for some appropriate way forward, we are
                                  compelled to consider Information and Communication
                                  Technology since alternatives are few and far between in the
                                  current situation and that too which renders direct in-person
                                  education immensely difficult. Hence we are frankly talking
                                  about increasing propensity to adopt this new paradigm of
                                  technology driven teaching-learning that stands on the pedestal
                                  of widely diffused and distance mode targeting a much broader

                                  pedagogues, harnessing collaboration with other institutional

                                  new knowledge eco-system. On one hand when the Covid-19
                                  pandemic has exposed our vulnerability, on the other hand it
                                  has highlighted that effective strategy in the face of such
                                  debilitating crisis could only be based on collective enterprise
                                  towards epistemological growth in sync with mutual trust,
                                  solidarity and creativity tailored to back up our policy makers
                                  and every sector from heath to education so that we can stay
                                  ahead with resilience to cope with such ‘Black Swan’ event and
                                  its calamitous impact on economies and national psyche. So,
                                  this thought that calls for new stewardship and a new network
                                  of deepening collaboration and partnership among institutions,
                                  seems critical to navigate human capital along the roadmap of

                                  it, the gamut of our effort springs from multiple nodes from
                                  issues of funding higher education to strengthen research
                                  capacity, public-private partnership, bridging the gap of digital

                                  maximum investment in educational sector while harnessing
                                  and optimizing the impact of such investment for universal and
                                  equitable social uplift. This edited volume is driven by this
                                  guiding thread that seeks to champion such holistic concerns
                                  while emphasizing the need to cultivate the values of
                                  accountability and trust through the teaching-learning process.

                                    We have already spent several decades since the launch of
                                  I.C.T from the fag-end of the twentieth century. In this current
                                  juncture our top-most priority is to revive and reconstruct the
                                  education system and to boost epistemological growth and its
                                  equitable distribution, so that we can gradually develop a
                                  needful education which can diffuse well to generate
                                  empowerment at the lower rung of society through accessibility,
                                  transparency and partnership. In the global milieu we need
                                  technological knowledge and also greater understanding to set
                                  our priorities for progress towards the SDGs. Hence we cannot
                                  ignore the issues that abound in our thought of how we can
                                  integrate technology or devise innovative knowledge strategies
                                  to achieve equity, harmony and rhythm in our national life and
                                  simultaneously which will be responsive to future shocks of
                                  pandemics. Here we can quote from the UN Research Roadmap
                                  for the Covid-19 Recovery. According to it, “With COVID-19
                                  serving as a grand revealer of the stark inequities, fragilities
                                  and unsustainable practices of the present and past, the world
                                  now faces a historic choice and opportunity to alter its trajectory.
                                  The key to success will be evidence-informed transformative
                                  changes that promote equity for everyone’s benefit, build
                                  resilience into critical systems and protect and restore the
                                  global environmental commons for generations to come.” (Chap
                                  5, pg117, UN, Nov 2020). It clearly lays stress on transformative
                                  changes, on recovery, on informative and innovative approaches
                                  and above all, embedding research with sustainable futuristic
                                  purpose.
                                    Undoubtedly expansion of knowledge in sync with changes
                                  in global market and media is continuing at an accelerated

                                  pace. Our ancestors’ contribution in this progress is pioneering
                                  and immense. But now the time has come to make and do
                                  things in new and novel ways; particularly in the pandemic
                                  situation we need strategic action to try to integrate I.C.T in the
                                  teaching learning process with great motive. Technology and
                                  collaboration are the twin vaults or ‘khazana’ that can help
                                  people and communities at large to achieve a better future. But
                                  its implementation needs to be moderated through a cautious
                                  step-by-step process through which educators and students are
                                  to be oriented anew for more customized learning while taking
                                  safeguards so that possible harms on student psyche could be
                                  minimized. It may happen that wide exposure to ICT might
                                  bring in health-related hazards like eye sore or insomnia.
                                  Similarly new games like pabji  might expose them to new
                                  intoxication and concomitant stresses like loss of identity when
                                  timely counseling would be necessary. So, pandemic induced
                                  closure and consequent switch-over to techno-savvy method
                                  might produce a state of dilemma when our immediate task
                                  would be to take guard against the “dehumanizing effect of
                                  Covid-19”. We often pay very scant attention to this vital aspect
                                  of student psychology. Hence we cannot simply talk about new
                                  information technology leaving aside its probable impact on the
                                  rural communities, impact on mental health and our limited
                                  capacity to afford online remote learning. To quote a UNICEF
                                  report “The global reach of broadcast and online remote
                                  learning from over 100 countries find that, at minimum, 30 per
                                  cent of the world’s children were not reached by remote
                                  learning during the COVID-19 school closures due to a lack of
                                  country-level remote learning policies and/ or a lack of household
                                  access to technology.” [UNICEF (2020) Covid-19: Are children
                                  able to continue learning during school closures?]. So even
                                  today we are way behind to introduce a techno-dependent
                                  mode as viable alternative to normal offline mode of teaching-
                                  learning. Of course this lack of online facilities does not
                                  invalidate the imperative need to impart digital literacy as

                                  banking strategy of future change-over and upgrading the
                                  educational processes. Conceptualization, participation of
                                  community in reframing and reorganizing educational processes,
                                  intensive interaction through web-meetings can open up the
                                  course, and validation comes step by step in the course of
                                  progress with innovative teaching technology. We believe that
                                  technology is a significant factor but the real game-changer is
                                  the involvement of civil society together with the activists,
                                  NGOs and teachers on whom the onus of developing and
                                  disseminating ingenuous materials like short videos, audios are
                                  entrusted. These are very exciting tools which can easily win
                                  the minds of young learners and revitalize enthusiasm of
                                  students through new format of online conversation. Here we
                                  can refer to Herbert Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences,
                                  which help us to appreciate the different types of intelligence
                                  of learners, thus requiring personalized learning patterns.
                                  Experience suggests that if we can make use of virtual mode
                                  successfully it can turn into a magnet to induce the attention of
                                  the target audience more effectively. In turn students can
                                  produce drawings, diagrams, charts or posters or even cassettes
                                  of their songs or recitations which then can be circulated and
                                  shared within groups or on the platform of virtual classrooms.
                                  There is no hard and fast rule, but the unique feature of this
                                  type of engagement is to facilitate learning in crisis time or at
                                  least to reach out to the students and to induce them to remain
                                  connected to their studies by making learning more personalized
                                  and outcome-oriented.
                                    Education is incomplete without taking into account the two
                                  most crucial aspects. One is obviously the difficulty of the
                                  situation as the unnatural state of sudden dislocation was
                                  created by the pandemic. Second is the distinct socio-economic
                                  and cultural setting in which the institution is located and
                                  educational processes are funneled through it. So, we cannot
                                  expect that every individual student would be equally equipped
                                  with same make-up and technological understanding. Hence

                                                                                      23]]></page><page Index="25"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  educational delivery is of crucial significance which must take
                                  into account local space, regional cultural mosaic, demographic
                                  composition and also its overall responsibility to support
                                  technological knowledge by instilling new learning experiences
                                  like virtual lab simulations etc. It basically requires an
                                  understanding that with the entry of technology the traditional
                                  learning space may change and in turn hitherto bond between
                                  teachers and students is likely to undergo a remarkable
                                  transformation. Hence the process may not only subject the
                                  students to a new experience but it may prove challenging for
                                  the teachers also since their new role as content developer of
                                  videos or recorded cassettes might undermine their formal
                                  institutional job. So reactions are obvious from apparent
                                  reduction of role of people into disposable objects. However,
                                  we are not indicating that situation would lead to any grave
                                  resistance or to a kind of Luddite reaction. It is because
                                  technology has always been an enabling driver of change and
                                  the prime factor in transforming the system as in India
                                  government has launched an important scheme of digital literacy
                                  under National Digital Literacy Mission and Digital Saksharta
                                  Abhiyan. These schemes are being introduced with an eye to
                                  narrowing down the existing digital gap. Like the role played
                                  by Aarogya Setu app in helping citizens during the recent
                                  Covid pandemic, we can find a new ambitious pathway if we
                                  can unleash our inner potential by means of bridging digital
                                  gaps with such programme of literacy supported by diffusion of
                                  more digital infrastructure and utilization of e-portals like
                                  DIKSHA, e-Pathsala etc. This implies that time has come to
                                  shift towards the e-class model which is desirable not only as
                                  a strategy for current crisis time but also for expediting our
                                  journey to “build a New India that is a leader” and a destination
                                  of academic proficiency.
                                    We hope the present volume would be immensely beneficial
                                  because it is based on large pool of ideas and thoughts as

                                  veritable game changer to lead the growth trajectory of our
                                  country. We admit that last year with sudden lockdown the
                                  entire rhythm of life was changed under what came to be
                                  known as ‘New Normal’. Yet it became the onus of the
                                  information scientists to figure out how to make this confinement
                                  less difficult, more humane, and soothing because now ‘the

                                  challenge was how we could transform the present stressful
                                  situation into a veritable basket of opportunity with the
                                  benevolent use of information and data science.

                                    We went through a recently released publication by the
                                  United Nations entitled UN Research for the COVID-19
                                  Recovery  (Nov 2020). It aptly states that “the challenges
                                  resulting from COVID-19 will require global solidarity and
                                  innovation”. So undoubtedly we cannot let the pandemic wash
                                  away our already hard-fought gains and advances that we have
                                  made towards achieving the set target of Sustainable
                                  Development Goals by 2030 that includes Education for all and
                                  similar benign objectives as our priorities. That is why we
                                  require wholehearted efforts for shifting towards learning from
                                  the web, learning freely and knowledge mobilization because
                                  all these are the steps that can encourage independence of
                                  views and innovation “in order to catalyze transformative
                                  changes” conducive for an equitable, resilient and sustainable
                                  future.
                                    After reviewing different studies, the editors cannot but
                                  concur with the findings of other investigators of four basic
                                  challenges like technological challenges, pedagogical problems,
                                  financial problems and behavioural challenges. Here let us
                                  refer to the “Domino effect of school closures” as depicted in
                                  the UN Research Roadmap.

                                    Source:  UN Research Roadmap for the COVID-19 Recovery
                                                      (November 2020)
                                    It says, “school closures not only interrupted learning but
                                  also limited access to other social protection measures. The
                                  nutritional status of children, especially in poor households, is
                                  expected to significantly deteriorate as a result of the pandemic,
                                  owing to reduced household income and the loss of school
                                  meals. Closures can also prevent parents, and particularly
                                  mothers, from engaging in the labour force due to increased
                                  care-giving responsibilities. Over the long-term, school closures
                                  will have country-wide consequences.”
                                    Obviously, in a low-resource setting, it is natural that the
                                  ground reality would be more adverse for the weaker and
                                  marginalized sections especially for dalits, women and minorities
                                  to access education through online mode. So, it creates an
                                  inequality in the education system which leads to identifiable
                                  constraint in the absence of sufficient backup support for
                                  achieving sustainable development goals. It affects a child’s
                                  development and well-being by segregating them from school
                                  and augmenting the risk and fallout of inequalities which can
                                  foster the dropout rate and create the barrier for getting free and

                                  compulsory education. But if we can “promote equitable access
                                  to internet infrastructure” along with sustained flow of
                                  government schemes to transfer financial benefits in favour of
                                  the members of the most vulnerable communities during this
                                  period when all schools remain closed, online learning could
                                  offer a major and undoubtedly better option to overcome the
                                  so-called barrier for education.
                                    Of course, there are many other subtle issues like quality of
                                  online education, quality of network affecting the
                                  communication, condition of home whether that is conducive
                                  enough to receive education or even it depends upon the
                                  adaptability of the learners to change their track to online-based
                                  learning platform. This type of sudden shift from synchronous
                                  to asynchronous, traditional to online based teaching learning
                                  can create an adverse effect on the education system mainly for
                                  the first generation learners hailing from backward, remote
                                  rural backwater. We may note that one third of school children
                                  are unable to access quality education due to the digital divide
                                  (UNICEF, 2020). Comparing between the developed and the
                                  developing countries, it was significantly found that developing
                                  countries were facing more challenges such as poor internet
                                  connectivity, lack of training in ICT  and weakness of content
                                  development than the situation in developed countries (Aung
                                  T.N et. al, 2015).

                                    In this pandemic affected situation, however, when
                                  technology-based learning appears to be one of the acceptable
                                  options for continuing the process of education then such
                                  contextual concern inevitably propels knowledge dissemination
                                  through alternative routes like activating our traditional
                                  knowledge system which is more or less local community
                                  centric. Similarly, the online mode can offer another learning
                                  opportunity for a broader and scattered audience by integrating
                                  them through a learning web that helps to change our traditional
                                  perception towards schooling and knowledge. Online learning
                                  refers to a smart approach of learning from one’s own premise


                                                                                      27]]></page><page Index="29"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  through the use of information and communication technologies
                                  like smart board, google classroom etc. Although the concept of
                                  online learning existed in the pre-pandemic era, it became
                                  highly popular reaching the highest peak within less than one
                                  year. Different online learning platforms like Zoom, MOOC,
                                  Google classroom, Ted-Ed, Classwize, CoursEra, Edmodo etc.
                                  have become famous and have increased their members rapidly.
                                  By the by, very recently while drafting this introduction we
                                  read one very interesting take published by Impact and Policy
                                  Research Institute, New Delhi regarding Emerging MOOC
                                  Markets: Perspectives from India and Bangladesh. This working
                                  paper enthused us in appraising the fast-emerging scenario
                                  while its suggestions to develop more online academic materials
                                  for students based on insights from intensive interactions
                                  among stakeholders and the need of banking on animations and
                                  appropriate video clippings convinced us that the EdTech
                                  market could proliferate beyond region and even during
                                  emergency lockdown period it could turn out to be most
                                  efficacious model for other regions beyond South Asia. It noted
                                  with due recognition as how Bangladesh government has
                                  successfully devised projects like Muktopath  and 10 Minute
                                  School, a private sector initiate which are currently playing a
                                  key role in the online educational landscape in Bangladesh.
                                  Needless to say, online learning has become a cheaper mode of
                                  education and very flexible also since it could reach to any
                                  location and is suitable for access by anyone. So now the
                                  government realizes the dynamic customer-friendly potentiality
                                  of online learning and tries to apply it in education sectors
                                  (Dhawan.S, 2020).  Previous studies have already proved that
                                  various technological tools could boost the interest of teaching
                                  learning among the students (Moazami .F et.al, 2014).
                                    Here topically we are more concerned with the pandemic
                                  ravaged situation and its challenges because we wanted to
                                  ensure to neutralize the threats of infection while simultaneously
                                  the urgency to open the channels of academic process was very

                                  would have gone to waste. So from that angle of designing
                                  appropriate context-driven response led to optimise learning
                                  through online education.
                                    The opportunity cost of COVID-19 and the process of
                                  online education

                                    The crisis of COVID-19 has posed by far the most severe
                                  challenge for ensuring the continuation of education and
                                  knowledge mobilization all over the world. But on the contrary
                                  it has helped to experiment with online education globally to
                                  create new pathways, practices and strategies. The
                                  experimentation process started in March 2020, and even after
                                  reopening the students have been using Swayam, MOOCs etc.
                                  Besides, our engagement during this long time experimentation
                                  has increased manifold. As a result, there are many educators
                                  and research scholars who could acclimatize with the changed
                                  context and thus they could develop new skills with digital
                                  literacy and collect new inputs in sync with their research
                                  priorities while adjusting with new sets of problems and
                                  forging innovative partnerships on virtual platforms. As the
                                  research scholars and educators in conducting research
                                  programme in the new setting wrote and published many
                                  articles that enriched the pool of online literature. Yet, there is
                                  no gainsaying the fact that conducting empirical study or doing
                                  field surveys or visiting locations for pilot study have become
                                  highly constrained than in the past. Simultaneously the online
                                  mode of learning was also beset with the Achilles heel of
                                  connectivity related issues. The present investigators also found
                                  out through interactions with the students that they have been
                                  through different types of challenges insofar as online learning
                                  is concerned.
                                    Let us briefly highlight those challenges first before we
                                  move on to highlight the ingenuity of a pioneering forum of
                                  state librarians in West Bengal “Sammilita Granthagar o
                                  Peshajibi Mancha” (‘Combined Library and Professional
                                  Forum’), which has taken a very commendable initiative to

                                                                                      29]]></page><page Index="31"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  circulate e-books, e-journals, magazines and newspapers, not
                                  merely for the sake of information but more to enable the
                                  students and youth to stay positive in approach in gloomy times
                                  of crisis. It is praise-worthy indeed for the idea of healthy
                                  response to such contingency that pledges to benefit all. But
                                  before narrating the interesting story of this benevolent initiative,
                                  we may cite technology-related glitches associated with the
                                  installation of different types of applications, login problems,
                                  problems with audio and video, etc. which can apprise us of the
                                  limitation of one-fits-all approach, hence the imperative need to
                                  appreciate that online process involves diverse actors, issues
                                  and perspectives. Even technology indirectly can bulldoze by
                                  usurping the place of educators or human agency and also it
                                  can homogenize cultures. So, when it makes possible
                                  reproduction of the education system everywhere, it has its
                                  flipsides too because covertly technology can treat the learners
                                  into knowledge consumers who would then be asked to buy the
                                  stuff. Such compulsion could contribute to the making of new
                                  control system when the original purpose of education to seek
                                  freedom of mind would be stultified.

                                    Unstable network connection:  The major component of
                                  online learning is internet connection (Adedoyin, O.B., &
                                  Soykan, E. 2020). Because most of the work is done through
                                  online platforms and social media, it is impossible to access
                                  online learning without internet connection. In India, the major
                                  problem is the unstable internet connection in rural areas.
                                  According to the World Bank report (January 2021), a majority
                                  (65.53%) of the population lived in villages in India. So
                                  through online learning urban people are taking advantage to
                                  get education easily while around one-third of people in the
                                  countryside are deprived of online education. There are many
                                  studies that reveal that one of the important challenges of
                                  accessing online learning for all is unstable network connection.
                                  (Mishra, L. et al. 2020, Adedoyin, O.B., & Soykan, E. 2020,
                                  Kamal, A.A. et al., 2020). One study shows that 79% of
                                  participants say that unstable network connection scuttles their

                                  30]]></page><page Index="32"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  interest during long-time online learning (Shetty, S. et. All.,
                                  2020). Another study says that a heavy internet bill poses a big
                                  challenge for continuing online classes basically for the students
                                  of low economic status (Putri et al., 2020).

                                    The use of the internet also creates a big disparity among
                                  different countries. World Development Indicators show that
                                  only 34.5% of people were used to the internet in 2017 in
                                  India. It creates a digital gap between the users of the internet
                                  and those who cannot access it properly. In this context,
                                  providing online education to all in the COVID-19 situation
                                  poses a big challenge. A study conducted by the NCERT (2020)
                                  reflects that approximately 27% of the students cannot use the
                                  internet because they do not have any smart phone or laptop.
                                    2. Pedagogical challenges:

                                    It consists of problems of instructional process and method
                                  of teaching procedure online, and its impact on students’
                                  learning. One study revealed that lack of meaningful interaction
                                  with teachers, and a low range of innovative teaching lead to
                                  low level of understanding of the concepts. It was also found
                                  that teachers were unable to understand the learners’ mood and
                                  to change the teaching instruction accordingly to maintain their
                                  interest (Mishra, L. et al. 2020). This study also exposed that
                                  teachers were unable to clarify their doubts and fulfill their
                                  learners’ satisfaction level by online mode. Pedagogical
                                  challenges are therefore a product of a lack of two-way
                                  interaction between students and teachers due to technical
                                  snag, sometimes over-emphasis on medium rather than agency
                                  and lack of emotional attachment during the instruction etc.
                                  (Mishra, L. et al. 2020). Although we cannot always generalise,
                                  yet in the process a culture of meek submission if not silence
                                  may be reinstated unless there is a conscious mindset to
                                  interrogate the understanding received from online sources.

                                    3. Financial challenges:  India is an emerging economic
                                  powerhouse but still the majority of the population belongs to


                                                                                      31]]></page><page Index="33"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  low economic status. For continuing the online mode learning
                                  many costly devices are required like smartphone/laptop, modem,
                                  internet connectivity, electricity etc. which are expensive.
                                  Another side is that due to the COVID-19 pandemic many
                                  people like the outstation workers were rendered jobless, and
                                  their family income became almost zero. So, it was another
                                  significant challenge for poor parents to sustain and support
                                  their child’s education through online mode that we cannot play
                                  down for it not only ushered in more harshness in the structure
                                  but prompted a rethink of how we could refashion the process
                                  so that redistribution of resources that became constrained,
                                  could be resuscitated to work for authentic subaltern
                                  empowerment.

                                    4. Behavioural challenges: Behavioural challenges refer to
                                  negative attitudes towards adopting new modes of learning and
                                  their negative impact on the students. A study also revealed that
                                  online lectures could lead to laziness and a negative effect on
                                  performance, and it also hampered the social relationship
                                  (Khalil, R. et al. 2020). Another study shows that 75% of
                                  students have opined that long time use of smart phones for
                                  online learning leads to different types of eye-related issues like
                                  to eye strain and headache.
                                    Put in this perspective it is natural that catering a digital
                                  library facility to a widely dispersed cross-section of people
                                  would not be a cakewalk. Yet the mission undertaken by the a
                                  group of librarians was stupendous. Quintessentially it was
                                  built upon the foundational idea that books are our best friend.
                                  To propagate and promote the idea, the librarians and book-
                                  enthusiasts collaborated and organised several online seminars
                                  all over the state of West Bengal. It exuded a deep sense of
                                  their commitment and passion to build a book-oriented society.
                                  In turn, they received tremendous response from general people
                                  from hill to jungle. It was evident that their creativeness led to
                                  a vibrant wave which succeeded in enthusing people to nurture
                                  interest in learning through the web. Through this platform they


                                  32]]></page><page Index="34"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  shared softcopies of various types of books, journals and
                                  information which constituted a goldmine of data. In short, it
                                  provided sustainable learning channels for enhancing intellectual
                                  capacity through greater exposure and facility to receive tailored
                                  information needed at such a critical juncture. In short, the
                                  service extended by the group was to act for creating a strategic
                                  knowledge bank which was highly responsive and sensitive to
                                  the demands heaped upon it from miscellaneous sources.
                                  Obviously it was an excellent team work with a microcosm
                                  whose motto was to champion the cause of literary culture by
                                  acting as a model engaged in 24x7 communication with people
                                  from teenagers to octogenarians, from housewives to NRIs and
                                  even reaching out to migrant workers. It was a herculean task
                                  indeed.
                                    The idea was to create a sharing platform on social media.
                                  It appealed to the public arrested in their own home to send
                                  their book requisitions and it turned into a wonderful response
                                  as people in thousands spontaneously sent requests for their
                                  favorite story books, newspapers and magazines. Some local
                                  dailies highlighted this benevolent initiative, and after that there
                                  was no question of taking a pause. Within 30 days of this
                                  initiative, the group started sending e-contents and PDF files,
                                  videos of lectures, documentaries to more than 20,000 people
                                  both within West Bengal and outside. It was an admirable feat.
                                  From child to the elderly, from young to the old, from doctors
                                  to engineers, from students to teachers and even the migrant
                                  workers engaged in other states were availing its services and
                                  getting benefitted. All these may unfurl a new horizon of
                                  knowledge, experience and intellectual fruition for the college
                                  and university students and faculties. In the words of Pranab
                                  Hazra, the Librarian of Sidho-Kanho-Birsha University of

                                  may be sent along with books to give a little fresh air to this
                                  miserable prisoner’s life. We have also been sending that. We
                                  have also given the link to online mental counselling. We have
                                  also arranged online examinations for university students. We
                                  also advertised on social media for students of other universities,
                                  especially those in rural areas, to avail this service.” Thus, it
                                  was playing an instrumental role in diffusing the mental stress
                                  of the bewildered victims at the critical hours of forced
                                  confinement with the healing touch of books and links to
                                  hundreds of online sources and inspirational videos.
                                    The current pandemic has become a litmus test for all of us.
                                  We fervently believe that more than the fear of infection, a far
                                  more potent enemy of people could be our depressive state of
                                  LONELINESS, hence it is to be banished once for all. Education
                                  during new normal must be credible and flexible enough to win
                                  back the confidence of the young learners and it must be
                                  carried out with the spirit of a mission mode to establish a
                                  Trust-worthy Knowledge Ecosystem. It sounds rhetorical but
                                  essentially the idea was benign and useful, yet uphill to achieve
                                  because we do not know whether the spirit would fade away as
                                  a transient ripple. However, it seems that the importance of its
                                  working, voluntarism, and a sense of commitment to explore a
                                  new path to carry forward our education and culture during the
                                  last one and half year cannot be ended in vain. With the advent
                                  of vaccines the pandemic may fizzle out and we would be
                                  switching to offline mode as things are progressing in that
                                  direction. Nevertheless, the mind will be wet with the grim
                                  memories of the Pandemic and whenever we shall talk of it, we
                                  shall talk of the sheer idealism permeating such constructive
                                  and innovative initiatives and practices. Today when consumerist
                                  craze is out to engulf society, such exercise is the only hope to
                                  keep alive the faith of a better tomorrow, a new dawn of
                                  intellectual enlightenment that can unite people for a powerful
                                  social coalition.

                                    Now a few words about Pandemic Research Strategy.
                                  For development of any country, human capital plays a pivotal
                                  role as well as the strategic factors which include assets like
                                  education, training, intelligence, skills, health, and other things
                                  employers value such as loyalty and punctuality. In education,
                                  the output of research can promote how pupils grow, adapt,
                                  learn and adjust with a changeable environment. Although
                                  during past two years the COVID-19 pandemic tremendously
                                  affected the higher education system as well as the research
                                  activities. Due to the barriers of lack of technological
                                  understanding and digital divide, the research faced huge
                                  challenges by which its progress was halted. So in this juncture,
                                  an important question for researchers is how to conduct field
                                  studies? Is this possible, and safe? And if not, should the
                                  research be changed, or wait for face-to-face participation to
                                  resume? (Mitchel.R, 2021). It also faces ethical challenges,
                                  which have to be carefully managed.
                                    But on the whole it cannot be conceded that the pandemic
                                  has halted research in a big way. Rather during the pandemic
                                  new research ideas related to many micro issues were generated
                                  and the young researchers took various steps to navigate
                                  research and thus strategize according to the changing situation.
                                  Yet, shift to virtual mode has its obvious limitations related to
                                  overload on server, over-reliance on digital platforms, credibility
                                  of data provided by unknown websites, delay in updating
                                  official sites and above all, the non-substitutability of going to
                                  the field directly for collection of data from grassroot level—
                                  from local bodies and communities. Hence what we perceived
                                  as a felt-need of the hour was to keep a research contingency
                                  plan ready so that it can help us to steer through such
                                  extraordinary circumstances. Such planning may range from
                                  setting priorities, i.e. efforts to focus on those aspects which are
                                  manageable and more routine in nature viz. doing literature
                                  review through accessible online platforms or nurturing
                                  additional research interests through wide reading that may
                                  cover important insights from previous case studies or may

                                                                                      35]]></page><page Index="37"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  help to consolidate theoretical understanding rather than taking
                                  up applied research to find out some solution at a particular
                                  context. So progress of research during abnormal pandemic-
                                  inflicted situation requires first of all in-depth pondering
                                  regarding the research design. Besides, the gamut of this
                                  exercise depends upon the population and its size to be
                                  covered. Here obviously the risk of direct interaction could
                                  multiply health threats, and putative difficulty of garnering
                                  public trust needs to be taken into account. The site like slums
                                  or refugee colonies where the survey is to be conducted may be
                                  harder to reach during or immediately after the ravages of the
                                  pandemic laying bare vulnerabilities of such places. Similarly it
                                  may also be remembered that during serious upward trend of
                                  infection spike which is visible again in certain pockets, local
                                  community or poor households may not like to be interviewed
                                  or there may be certain restrictions like physical distancing due
                                  to the possibility of rapid transmission of such highly
                                  communicable disease. Besides, the mood of the people may be
                                  depressed due to horizontal spread of the shock wave, thus
                                  transforming it an issue from public health to an overall
                                  economic and psychological crisis. Hence cross-sectoral outlook
                                  to find the links between the subject of study and related areas
                                  is also important to enhance the validity of findings and later
                                  these insights can aid policy responses for better delivery of
                                  public goods. Hence research during the current pandemic can
                                  be instrumental to expand the contours of knowledge while
                                  their findings could offer the bedrock of innovative experiments
                                  and reforms needed to promote human security at large. This
                                  basic understanding informs the fundamental approach that lies
                                  at the core of this volume and every piece of this compilation
                                  reflects and echoes this overarching concern and caution in one
                                  way or the other.

                                    To begin with Dr. M. Jagadesh’s paper delves into various
                                  aspects and technicalities of flipped classroom which provides
                                  a distinct learning environment in which learners might need
                                  mentoring and guidance that enhances cooperative

                                  classroom. Likewise Anjan Karak’s paper is an elaboration and
                                  extension of the idea of flipped classroom and its key features
                                  with detailed attention to its different facets, merits and probable
                                  difficulties that constitutes the discursive framework and its
                                  normative turn. Khusbu Sharma’s paper is designed to compare
                                  blended, flipped and machine learning. She is insightful in
                                  arguing that digital technology at large can transform the
                                  learning experience with more intensive use of internet-based
                                  devices and interesting videos to revitalize the teacher-student
                                  interface and thus stimulating enthusiasm of young generation.
                                  This technologically driven change in education during high
                                  rate of Covid infection finds fairly engaging and analytical
                                  articulation in Soma Banerjee’s paper as she defines virtual
                                  class room as a web-based conference that is highly user-
                                  friendly and interactive. It becomes evident from her discussion
                                  that this emerging trend and shift towards virtual classroom
                                  signifies the advent of a new stage coterminous with
                                  unprecedented knowledge dissemination and which is indicative
                                  of our familiarity and socialization and educational growth to
                                  shape new aspiration among traditionally deprived population.
                                  Thus virtual classroom becomes the new lingua franca of post-
                                  pandemic education with students’  energetic association and
                                  diffusion of empowerment. This and many other related aspects
                                  found articulation in Sodabibi A. Farooqui’s paper entitled
                                  Changing Landscape of Higher Education after Covid-19.
                                    We cannot but agree with the contention of Dr. Mirza
                                  Mahefooz Baig that there are certain challenges of equity
                                  which need to be addressed if we are planning to continue
                                  Online Teaching- learning. So, under the compulsion when we
                                  are facing the difficult task of switching to online teaching-
                                  learning as predominant mode, we need to take into consideration
                                  of stark inequities and fragilities that mark our society. To
                                  substantiate the point Dr. Baig quotes from the latest data from
                                  TRAI in February 2020 to show that India has around 115

                                  access to broadband-quality internet. Besides, broadband in
                                  India is defined as equal to/or above 512 kbps in terms of
                                  download speed. So, in a country of around 130 crores, around
                                  only half currently has access to a decent standard of internet.
                                  Hence during the pandemic when millions were pushed out of
                                  job, thus adding more severity to socio-economic disparities,
                                  providing support to financially marginalized families was
                                  perceived as an enabling factor to bolster the shift in teaching-
                                  learning process.
                                    Similarly Dr. Savita Mishra’s paper underscores the fact that
                                  Internet is a game changer with wide circulation of eBooks, e-
                                  counseling with reduced cost although its consequences are not
                                  always beneficial but rather negative findings like overburdening
                                  of teachers, slackening of teacher-student relationship and
                                  festering connectivity issue are new and it is imperative that we

                                  They have aptly shown how knowledge generation and

                                  might be problematic, hence requiring to impart online
                                  professional training to the teachers to enable them to face the
                                  challenges and empower them to fulfill the goal of education

                                  opine that with a decisive shift towards digital medium in
                                  education, a well-developed online course is prerequisite to
                                  open up new vistas of futuristic learning for students.
                                    There is a common thread of unity binding three contributors
                                  namely Dr. Santosh Behera and Rizwana and Md. Ismail. In
                                  their papers they have highlighted important views of how to
                                  overcome barriers of online education through designing proper
                                  strategy for effective learning of two subjects, viz. mathematics
                                  (as in the joint paper of Rizwana and Md. Ismail) and language
                                  (in Santosh Behera’s paper). According to Rizwana and Md.
                                  Ismail, “mathematical thinking occurs through a sophisticated
                                  semiotic coordination of speech, body, gestures, symbols, and
                                  tools. It is difficult to achieve sufficient interaction in an online
                                  learning environment by displaying mathematical concepts and
                                  symbols, which play a significant role in mathematics education,
                                  solely through use of a keyboard. This seems to be a limitation
                                  in the process of learning mathematics by online learners”.
                                  However, they have averred that now in schools children learn
                                  mathematics through online games available in various websites.
                                  Teachers need to be encouraged to create videos for online
                                  classes. Thus, teaching mathematics for kids has become more
                                  interesting rather than the traditional classroom teaching whereas
                                  teaching of mathematics in higher classes and colleges has been
                                  made effective by creating effective lesson plans and lesson
                                  notes. Lesson notes may be in the form of PPT presentation,
                                  hand written notes and pdfs. So, with this set of tools online
                                  education could be rapidly responsive to emergency situation

                                  Mookerjee’s paper harps upon the same string in emphasizing
                                  the need of new orientation or the customized approach to
                                  learning in the post-pandemic period. He discerns a great deal

                                  the Post-Pandemic situation can be realized through online
                                  teaching-learning process.
                                    An important aspect of teaching-learning during pandemic
                                  infected state of affairs and now when we are slowly steering
                                  through the recovery stage is obviously the adoption of suitable
                                  technology and its critical role to facilitate sharing of data and
                                  curricular delivery. Thus with the advent of home-based online
                                  learning, education system has undergone a huge qualitative
                                  overhaul due to the application of skill in ICT and in terms of
                                  flexibility of the process of learning, choice-based learning etc.
                                  While all these aspects of techno-centered education are
                                  indicative of the emergence of futuristic education approach,
                                  the reality of Indian context have been subjected to exhaustive
                                  discussion in the papers of Madhumita Chakraborty, Sarojini
                                  Mishra, Kuntal Roy, and Sukla Sinha. They have interpreted
                                  the transformation from the perspectives of the impact of
                                  Industry 4.0, rise of psychological stress, addiction to
                                  smartphones, job squeeze with increasing demand of skilled
                                  personnel etc.
                                    In this volume there are several articles which can be
                                  classified and clustered as government initiatives to promote
                                  the mission of e-learning and to achieve academic excellence
                                  through ICT  during Covid-19 pandemic. The narrative of
                                  Guriya Sharma’s paper and that of Indrani Ruidas amply reveal
                                  that the landscape of higher education has not only changed
                                  with introduction of new tools and capsules and government
                                  coming forward to encourage online education but we also
                                  need sustainable policy for technology-enabled learning and its
                                  systematic implementation with community participation to
                                  create a network and trust. Here we can situate the paper of
                                  Ruma Gayen and Nibedita Pramanik that deals at length with
                                  ICT. Their perspective is permeated by fine arguments and
                                  appreciation of various kinds of ICT products which not only
                                  help keep the interface between learners and instructors despite
                                  the unusual rupture caused by imposition of lockdown but the

                                  detailed description of ICT also suggests that the trend forms a
                                  new dynamic like a structural shift happening in post-pandemic
                                  situation. Yet it does not construct any generalization save and
                                  except showing the efficacy of ICT  specifically at a critical
                                  juncture where conditions were extremely uphill to reach the
                                  students community physically. Sanjib Bhattacharya’s paper
                                  takes the point a bit further although it shares the overall
                                  concern due to the dip in output in both education and service
                                  sector since the outbreak of the pandemic wrecked havoc. Yet
                                  as he talks about speedy transition of business to a remote
                                  operating model or work from home model, we could discern
                                  in that flexibility a human centric work methodology instead of
                                  pushing things in the direction of human dissociation spurred
                                  by higher mechanization and Artificial Intelligence in the neo-
                                  liberal world. According to Bhattacharya, e-learning saves lots
                                  of time and efforts that gets invested on travelling to schools
                                  and colleges. Students find more time to study and enhance
                                  their skills and knowledge at home. It shows how the new
                                  praxis with disposition towards distance mode of education
                                  symbolizes a paradigm shift based on rational response to
                                  massive ecological hazard like the Covid dislocation. However,
                                  if we look into the paper of Rupesh Mahato and Laxmiram
                                  Gope concerned with the attitudes towards online learning
                                  among the post-graduate students in Purulia district of West
                                  Bengal we find outcomes embracing both challenges and
                                  opportunities in education process through online mode.
                                    In some papers we find insightful thought-exercise not only
                                  regarding the challenges faced by the teachers as well as
                                  students while joining the online classes but also the methods
                                  of how these challenges can be optimally tackled. For example
                                  we can refer to at least three papers of Biplab and Riya
                                  Auddya, of Sharmistha Singha and Astik Mahato. They have
                                  portrayed the scenario with great sensitivity and nuances and at
                                  the same time their suggestions to navigate teaching-learning
                                  and research during the pandemic induced lockdown conditions
                                  reflect lots of adaptation, innovation and wisdom. In a way Arif

                                  Ansari’s paper connects to this category as he delineated his
                                  research experience during the conjunctural Covid crisis. In
                                  fact, Covid left a profound impact on knowledge mobilization
                                  efforts and research strategies since the situation of panic and
                                  extreme insecurity made the community and researchers more
                                  vulnerable than usual field condition. So the challenge of data
                                  collection made it extremely difficult to access the field except
                                  risk taking venture due to high degree of restrictions on
                                  movement, closure of workplaces, suspension of travel and
                                  transport, shutting down of railway network, its acute emotional
                                  impact on millions of people and subsequently great human
                                  migration of workers and their families, which gave birth to an
                                  ubiquitous and unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe. Hence
                                  it was a matter of huge concern to collect and harness data with
                                  ease and proper method. Although online sources, media
                                  platforms helped open data sharing tailored to the purpose of
                                  researchers. We also find some context-specific improvisations
                                  on the part of researchers where close collaboration and
                                  partnership among researchers proved to be an effective approach
                                  to meet urgent needs. But the most pressing need of the hour
                                  was how to steer through complex situation with novelty of
                                  thought and overall understanding. Hence in some papers like
                                  that of Manas Khan and Moumita Mondal’s, we find sort of a
                                  macro perspective whereby they have aptly spoken of public-
                                  private partnership, greater communication skill between teacher
                                  and students and also to create and deliver quality content in
                                  online education so that the laudable promise of implementing
                                  SDG-4, i.e. about quality education for all by 2030 can be
                                  achieved. Over and above it shows a mindset that young
                                  scholars were determined to transform the new crises as
                                  opportunities with tremendous resilience to overcome the
                                  adversity. We can’t but appreciate it wholeheartedly.

                                    Some papers in this compilation are a bit different because

                                  aspects like opinion and perception of students and teachers
                                  towards new models like massive open online courses (in short,
                                  MOOCs) and also study variance among the teachers and
                                  students towards the pandemic situation. For instance in the

                                  Gope the authors sought to study the responses of teachers and
                                  students  about the impact of Covid-19 on teaching learning
                                  system in Purulia district. It was a micro-level study with the

                                  there was no significant difference between teachers and students
                                  in relation to the attitudinal variance of impact of COVID-19 in
                                  education systems of Purulia district in West Bengal. On the

                                  expressed by the B.Ed. students of MOOCs covering
                                  postgraduate programme in all subjects including professional
                                  courses. Similarly in the well-researched paper by Dr. Pratik
                                  Ghosh we find application of case study method to showcase
                                  the steps adopted by the Gandhi Memorial Museum, Barrackpore
                                  to shift to online mode both through streaming live events and
                                  through the creation of digital materials to make use of virtual
                                  reality. In this regard the paper on Microvita in the light of an
                                  eminent philosopher Pravat Ranjan Sarkar popularly known as
                                  Anandamurttiji by Bedabati Chowdhury deserves mention for
                                  its application as a combating strategy during the Covid-19.
                                  This paper explores a unique optimistic humanistic approach
                                  which can heal the mind of millions during the most tortuous
                                  episode that the Covid-19 had brought about. Although
                                  constructed during 1986-89, according to professor Chowdhury,
                                  the lessons of Microvita carry a value-based ideology to
                                  inculcate a positive mindset to achieve a healthy and holistic
                                  outlook. So if we think that the outbreak of the pandemic is the
                                  result of multiple and combined exploitation—pychological,
                                  economic, political, cultural, and intellectual in different sphere
                                  of society, then logically a broad spectrum of thought based on

                                  Farooqui’s insightful view that although our future education
                                  system would rely more on digitalization yet it is still undergoing
                                  an evolving stage. Hence there is imperative need for a proper
                                  body like a high-powered task force with a good mix of
                                  bureaucrats, educationists, school-owners and policy makers
                                  from across states/regions under the stewardship of the Ministry
                                  of Human Resource Development to draw up detailed guidelines
                                  for dissemination of education with this mode to bring quality
                                  and uniformity. And this the crucial need of the hour. So we
                                  need to seize this opportunity of intervention aiming at
                                  formulating a new vision at a critical juncture not for pushing
                                  students to learn from computer and internet alone but at the
                                  same time our emphasis must be on exploring creativity of
                                  students and to make learning an enjoyable, shared and inclusive
                                  process with broader concerns to play the role of drivers of
                                  future research agendas and evoke trust and command credibility
                                  in the eye of population at large. We admit that our ambition is
                                  stupendous, and the concatenation of factors to be addressed is
                                  complex but the implication of message that emerges from the
                                  voices of the contributors on the whole provides us with the
                                  conviction that the mission is accomplishable if we can imbue

                                  systematically with debate to guide our actions wisely.
                                    Finally we would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge
                                  the debt that we have incurred to a group of brilliant scholars
                                  and bright faculties who have liberally contributed their thought
                                  to make this project a success. The takes based on their studies
                                  and in-depth analyses of the trends related to teaching-learning
                                  and research during the Covid-19 pandemic are thought-
                                  provoking and intellectually stimulating. It impelled us to
                                  engage ourselves seriously to understand and appreciate the
                                  nuances of the crisis and to talk about the praxis based on their
                                  suggestions. Thus we think these essays taken together might
                                  help to shape discussion on the inchoate area of teaching-
                                  learning and research during the pandemic. So we are grateful
                                  to each of the contributors who generously responded to our
                                  proposal of bringing out an edited volume.
                                    During the course of this work, we consulted many books
                                  and reports and simultaneously we interacted with a number of
                                  scholars and contacted distinguished teachers including Professor
                                  Ramakanta Mohalik of Regional Institute of Education,
                                  Bhubaneswar on many aspects and issues related to online
                                  teaching-learning and research. And must we acknowledge the
                                  debt that we owe to them for their benign cooperation that
                                  opened up new reservoir of insights for us, hence our gratitude
                                  to them for giving us their valuable time and for sharing with
                                  us some snippets of their valuable experience. However, our
                                  efforts would not have been complete without the crucial
                                  support received from Prof. (Dr.) Dipak Kumar Kar, Honourable
                                  Vice-Chancellor of Sidho-Kanho-Birsha University and Prof.
                                  (Dr.) Sonali Mukherjee, the publication in-charge of the
                                  university who saw the potential in this edited volume and
                                  granted permission for publication of this volume from the
                                  publication cell of Sidho-Kanho-Birsha University. Hence we
                                  express our profound gratitude to them for their trust on us.

                                  all our colleagues spanning over three faculties for we think
                                  that this volume though caters to a particular field has a wider
                                  frame where it shares a common dialogic space with other
                                  disciplines and that convergence is a potential area of cross-
                                  fertilization of ideas and broader intellectual matrix. Therefore
                                  in one way or the other, we are also beholden to our esteemed
                                  colleagues, students and research scholars who constitute the

                                  Abstract

                                  Flipped Learning is an approach that allows teachers to
                                  implement a specific methodology or various methodologies
                                  within their classrooms. Flipped Learning is intentionally student-
                                  centered and is built upon four pillars – flexible environment,
                                  learning culture, intentional content, and professional educator.
                                  Flipped learning is not a synonym of online videos of online
                                  courses, but is a blending of direct instruction with constructivist
                                  learning. Flipped learning requires learners to autonomously
                                  study at home and collaboratively study in class. In such a
                                  learning environment, learners might need tutoring or mentoring
                                  that helps their individual learning at home, and facilitation or
                                  guidance that enhances cooperative communication and
                                  collaborative activities in class.
                                    Key words: Flipped Learning, flexible environment, learning
                                  culture, intentional content, professional educator.

                                    Flipped Learning

                                    Flipped Learning is an approach that allows teachers to
                                  implement a specific methodology or various methodologies
                                  within their classrooms. The terms “flipped classroom” and
                                  “flipped learning” are not interchangeable. Flipping a class can,
                                  but does not necessarily, leads to Flipped Learning. Teachers
                                  may flip their classes by having students read text outside of
                                  class, watch supplemental videos or solve additional problems.
                                    The Flipped Learning model allows teachers to focus face-
                                  to-face instructional time on hands-on learning activities and
                                  personalized instruction by delivering direct instruction through
                                  an online platform like Google Classroom. Flipped Learning is
                                  intentionally student-centered and is built upon four pillars –
                                  flexible environment, learning culture, intentional content, and
                                  professional educator.

                                    The Four Pillars of F-L-I-P
                                    Flexible Environment
                                    Flipped Learning allows for a variety of learning modes;
                                  educators often physically rearrange their learning spaces to
                                  accommodate a lesson or unit, to support either group work or
                                  independent study. They create flexible spaces in which students
                                  choose when and where they learn. Furthermore, educators
                                  who flip their classes are flexible in their expectations of
                                  student timelines for learning and in their assessments of
                                  student learning.
                                    Indicators for flexible environment:
                                    § F.1 - I establish spaces and time frames that permit
                                       students to interact and reflect on their learning as
                                       needed.

                                    § F.2 - I continually observe and monitor students to make
                                       adjustments as appropriate.
                                    § F.3 - I provide students with different ways to learn
                                       content and demonstrate mastery.

                                    Learning Culture

                                    In the traditional teacher-centered model, the teacher is the
                                  primary source of information. By contrast, the Flipped Learning
                                  model deliberately shifts instruction to a learner-centered
                                  approach, where in-class time is dedicated to exploring topics
                                  in greater depth and creating rich learning opportunities. As a
                                  result, students are actively involved in knowledge construction
                                  as they participate in and evaluate their learning in a manner
                                  that is personally meaningful.
                                    Indicators for Learning Culture:

                                    § L.1 - I give students opportunities to engage in meaningful
                                       activities without the teacher being central.

                                    § L.2 - I scaffold these activities and make them accessible
                                       to all students through differentiation and feedback.
                                    Intentional Content

                                    Flipped Learning Educators continually think about how
                                  they can use the Flipped Learning model to help students
                                  develop conceptual understanding, as well as procedural fluency.
                                  They determine what they need to teach and what materials
                                  students should explore on their own. Educators use Intentional
                                  Content to maximize classroom time in order to adopt methods
                                  of student-centered, active learning strategies, depending on
                                  grade level and subject matter.
                                    Indicators for Intentional Content:

                                    § I.1 - I prioritize concepts used in direct instruction for
                                       learners to access on their own.

                                    § I.2 - I create and/or curate relevant content (typically
                                       videos) for my students.

                                    § I.3 - I differentiate to make content accessible and
                                       relevant to all students.

                                  traditional one. During class time, they continually observe
                                  their students, providing them with feedback relevant in the
                                  moment, and assessing their work. Professional Educators are
                                  reflective in their practice, connect with each other to improve
                                  their instruction, accept constructive criticism, and tolerate
                                  controlled chaos in their classrooms. While Professional
                                  Educators take on less visibly prominent roles in a flipped
                                  classroom, they remain the essential ingredient that enables
                                  Flipped Learning to occur.

                                    Indicators for Professional Educator:
                                    § P.1 - I make myself available to all students for individual,
                                       small group, and class feedback in real time as needed.
                                    § P.2 - I conduct ongoing formative assessments during
                                       class time through observation and by recording data to
                                       inform future instruction.
                                    § P.3 - I differentiate to make content accessible and
                                       relevant to all students.
                                    Types of Flipped Learning Classrooms
                                    There is more than one way of flipping a classroom. The
                                  idea is to customize delivery methods that suit the subject field
                                  and type of learner. Some of the types of blended learning that
                                  inspire flipped learning act as underlying models.

                                    Blended Learning Models
                                    Rotation Model
                                    It is the most widely used format in blended learning. In
                                  fact, flipped learning can itself be treated as a subset of this
                                  category. The students are exposed to rotation of lectures for a
                                  subject between face-to-face classroom instruction and online
                                  instruction. The face-to-face interaction may include full class

                                  or small-group instruction, group projects or individual
                                  discussion.






















                                    Flex Model
                                    The Flex model comprises the making of every class a
                                  mixture of online instruction and classroom interaction. This is
                                  different from the rotation model as every class is converted
                                  into online instruction and classroom time. In the rotation
                                  model, there are only one or two courses that are divided in this
                                  manner. The school implementing a flex model resembles
                                  office areas as students are provided cubicles for online
                                  instruction. Classrooms of different sizes are used for small-
                                  group lessons, group activities, doubt clearing, individual
                                  counselling, or just tutoring.
                                    Enriched Virtual Model

                                    In this model, there is a clear division of work for school
                                  and home. Unlike the flex model, students don’t attend school
                                  every day. For example, students in a school from Grade Six to
                                  Grade Eight come on say Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
                                  Different days are assigned to different classes. The rest of the
                                  days are devoted to online instruction to be studied at home.

                                    Flipped Classroom Models

                                    Flipped classrooms can be divided into the following subtypes
                                  depending on the variation in the distribution of study material,
                                  use of classroom time, or type of students.
                                    Standard Inverted Classroom
                                    It’s the classic flipped classroom. The learners are asked to
                                  go through the lecture videos and other study material that are
                                  prerequisites for the next class. Usually, all the aspects of a
                                  topic are converted into video lectures. The class time is
                                  reserved for practicing the concepts studied at home and to
                                  improve the students’ understanding in various ways like a one-
                                  to-one interaction with the teacher.
                                    Micro Flipped Classroom
                                    In this type of classroom, short video lectures are distributed
                                  as study material along with short assignments. The rest of the
                                  lecture and assignments are conducted during the classroom
                                  time.
                                    Discussion-Oriented Flipped Classroom

                                    Homework is assigned in the form of video lectures and
                                  external video resources. Discussions happen in the classroom
                                  time where topics are explored further. Having studied the
                                  basics, students can add value to discussion.

                                    Demonstration-Based Flipped Classroom
                                    Subjects like Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics, etc. require
                                  careful instructions to deliver content. For example, precision is
                                  key in a subject like geometry. In demonstration-based
                                  classrooms, screen recording tools are used to create instructional
                                  videos assigned as homework. Instead of doing this in the
                                  classroom, students can go back and forth in the video to
                                  understand concepts fully and come back to the classroom for
                                  doubt removal.

                                    Faux-Flipped Classroom

                                    This is a specific model targeting young learners. The aim
                                  is to replace the homework with instructional lecture-videos
                                  and other resources. When students come back to the classroom,
                                  one-to-one guidance and support are provided by the teacher.

                                    Group-Based Flipped Classroom
                                    The group-based model focuses on group learning. After the
                                  students have studied the material provided, they work together
                                  on assignments during the classroom time. The students learn
                                  by explaining concepts to each other, which improves retention.

                                    Virtual Flipped Classroom
                                    Classroom time for tutoring is completely eliminated in this
                                  model. Educators, like university professors, share all the
                                  resources and allocate time for individual sessions during office
                                  hours. Assignments are collected online through learning
                                  management systems.
                                    Role-Reversal 2.0 (Flipping the Teacher)

                                    Classrooms usually have students as the centre point of
                                  learning as opposed to having the educator as the focal point of
                                  information dissemination.

                                    The role-reversal concept is to flip the teacher. Here,
                                  students are also asked to create videos demonstrating their
                                  understanding. Students can film their group activities or can
                                  film themselves. The teacher can assess their progress in the
                                  subject through these videos. An advantage of this format is
                                  that these videos build a repository of references that can be
                                  used in future classes.
                                    The above models give us a fair idea of various formats that
                                  are being used for flipping classrooms. Using these techniques,
                                  you can customize an individual format to suit your own
                                  classroom. Blended learning is all about sensible experimentation
                                  and customization, according to the needs and requirements of
                                  the students.

                                                                                      53]]></page><page Index="55"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                    Tools to create a Flipped Classroom

                                    The principal study material in flipped classrooms comprises
                                  of video lectures, slideshows, audio lectures, screencast or
                                  instructional videos, and engaging animation. Few tools can be

                                    Tools for  Screen casting
                                    Educators use screen casting software to do a recording of
                                  their computer screen that can be used to create a lecture video.
                                  Teachers can also record their tablet screen as they write on it.
                                  The software records audio of the instructor and in some cases
                                  video too (using a webcam). Some of the popular software for
                                  screen casting are:

                                    While some teachers prefer screencasting, others like to
                                  simply use a video camera (or a smartphone) to record
                                  instructional videos. A number of professional tools are present

                                       polls, and activities; send digital badges for recognition;
                                       collaborate with students; and insert ready-made activities,
                                       videos, and other resources from a dedicated marketplace.

                                    Some Miscellaneous Tools
                                    These are some miscellaneous tools which are useful.
                                    § Audio/Video narration in Power Point Presentation- We
                                       can add audio/video narration to the slides. Also,
                                       Microsoft PowerPoint displays the slide timings or the
                                       time spent on each slide so that a teacher can analyze
                                       better. PowerPoint also records the use of highlighter,
                                       eraser, or pen.
                                    § Sheppard Software - Redirect students to a world of
                                       educational games. Students will really benefit from

                                                                                      55]]></page><page Index="57"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  Abstract
                                  There is a paradigm shift in teaching learning activity that is
                                  from face-to-face teaching to online Teaching. Now we have
                                  returned to normalcy but the pandemic situation has made us
                                  familiar with online teaching learning. The New Education
                                  Policy-2020 has also talked about alternative mode of education/
                                  online education. But there are certain challenges of equity
                                  which need to be addressed if we are planning to continue
                                  online teaching learning process. Online learning often refers to
                                  learning remotely through carefully designed and delivered
                                  lessons. The first and foremost challenge of equity in online
                                  teaching-learning is inadequate availability of the infrastructure.
                                  The second challenge to be addressed is the paucity of resources,
                                  as many families may not be able to afford sufficient number
                                  of electronic devises for all their kids. The third and the most
                                  important challenge to be addressed is lack of digital literacy.
                                  The next challenge relates to lack of trained teachers fit for
                                  online teaching job.

                                    Key words: Online Teaching Learning, Equity, Digital
                                  Divide and Digital Literacy.

                                    Online learning is not new to us, as we are aware that many

                                  organizing teaching learning process in the form of blended
                                  learning that is there were face-to-face classes as well as
                                  classes’ were conducted online also. The online classes may be
                                  synchronous or asynchronous. The online classes were
                                  supplementary to face-to-face classes. But due to the pandemic
                                  since last one and half year have forced institutes at all levels
                                  to shut. Entrance and recruitment exams have been postponed.
                                  According to the UNESCO, the education of 91 percent of
                                  students worldwide was disrupted. The latest UNESCO report
                                  on the impact of COVID-19 on education has noted that around
                                  32 crores students in India have been affected by this.
                                    The pandemic conditions compelled the institutions to opt
                                  for alternative mode of teaching learning as the process of
                                  education delivery must go on. We could make our children sit
                                  idle at home, Online was the only alternative Thus there was a
                                  paradigm shift in teaching learning activity, that was from face-
                                  to-face teaching to online teaching. Now we have returned to
                                  normalcy but the pandemic situation has made us familiar with
                                  online teaching learning. Besides, the New Education Policy-
                                  2020 has talked about alternative mode of education/ online
                                  education in following words “New circumstances and realities
                                  require new initiatives. The recent rise in epidemics and
                                  pandemics necessitates that we are ready with alternative
                                  modes of quality education whenever and wherever traditional
                                  and in-person modes of education are not possible. It calls for
                                  carefully designed and appropriately scaled pilot studies to
                                  determine how the benefits of online/digital education can be
                                  reaped while addressing or mitigating the downsides. In the
                                  meantime, the existing digital platforms and ongoing ICT-based
                                  educational initiatives must be optimized and expanded to meet
                                  the current and future challenges in providing quality education
                                  for all.” (NEP, 2020) But there are certain challenges of equity

                                  which need to be addressed if we are planning to continue
                                  Online Teaching learning.
                                    Let us consider what precisely online learning means?

                                    Definition of Online Learning
                                    Online Learning can be defined as
                                    1. Online learning often refers to learning remotely through
                                       carefully designed and delivered lessons.
                                    2. Online education is electronically supported learning
                                       that relies on the Internet for teacher-student interaction
                                       and the distribution of class materials. [4]
                                    ONLINE TEACHIG LEARNING AND CHALLENGES
                                  OF EQUITY
                                    The challenges of equity need to be addressed are as
                                  follows:
                                    Infrastructure
                                    The first and foremost challenge of equity in online teaching
                                  and learning is the availability of the infrastructure. “As per the
                                  latest data from TRAI in February 2020, India has around 115
                                  crore wireless subscribers, of which around 66 crore have
                                  access to broadband-quality internet. Broadband in India is
                                  defined as equal to/or above 512 kbps in terms of download
                                  speed. So in a country of around 130 crore, around half
                                  currently has access to a decent standard of internet.

                                    According to the Annual Status of Education (ASER) study
                                  conducted in 2018, of 596 government schools belonging to
                                  619 districts, only 21.3 percent of students had access to
                                  computers in their schools. Now let’s look at this from the
                                  perspective of students. Again, only some students from
                                  privileged families may have access to computers and personal
                                  smartphone or tablets. The 2011 Census reveals just 9.4 percent
                                  of households in the country had either a laptop or a computer,


                                                                                      61]]></page><page Index="63"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  and only three percent of these homes had an internet
                                  connection.”(Srivastav, 2020).
                                    Resources: The second challenge needed to be addressed is
                                  the availability of resources, as many families, who have n-
                                  numbers of kids, may not have sufficient numbers of electronic
                                  devises for all their kids. “While 20 percent of urban households
                                  and five percent of rural households owned a computer or
                                  laptop, a mere one percent of rural Indian households owned a
                                  computer with internet access. Even if we assume that these
                                  numbers have doubled or tripled over the past decades, we
                                  surmise that still leaves out a large number of people. Even
                                  with the increase in smartphone ownership, not many students
                                  in low-income households and rural areas may have access to
                                  computers, personal smartphones or reliable internet connections,
                                  which would allow them to participate in online learning
                                  initiatives.”(Srivastav, 2020).
                                    Digital literacy: The third and the most important challenge
                                  to be addressed relate to Digital Literacy. A  student without
                                  digital literacy will unable to involve wholly in Online Teaching
                                  Learning.
                                    Digital literacy refers to an individual’s ability to find,
                                  evaluate, and compose clear information through writing and
                                  other media on various digital platforms. “The National Digital
                                  Literacy Mission (NDLM) was approved in March 2014 and
                                  had a target to train 10 lakh citizens in select districts.
                                  Subsequently, the Digital Saksharta Abhiyan (DISHA) was
                                  approved in December 2014 with an additional target of 42.5
                                  lakh candidates across the country.
                                    The coverage targets have been increased under the Pradhan
                                  Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan (PMGDISHA), which
                                  seeks to make six crore persons in rural India digitally literate.
                                  However, Till October 2018, around two crore individuals have
                                  been covered, which is just 1.67 percent of India’s population.
                                  These schemes are mostly focused on rural areas, leaving us

                                  with no reliable indicators about the number of people in India
                                  who can be called digitally literate.” (Srivastav, 2020) and also
                                  “The government has identified 55,000 villages that lack even
                                  mobile phone coverage. More important, digital literacy in
                                  India is estimated to be less than 10 per cent of the
                                  population.”(Mohanty, 2020).

                                    Digital Divide
                                    The fourth challenge related to equity is that Online Teaching
                                  Learning can create Digital Divide among the students of
                                  Indian society. “This can be seen in how the syllabus mentions
                                  that since ICT infrastructure may not be available in all
                                  schools, state boards can come up with a different method of
                                  assessment, leading to a lack of standardization in the assessment
                                  of digital literacy levels among students of different states, and
                                  affecting the quality of skills learnt by students from poorer
                                  states.” (Srivastav, 2020)
                                    “UNESCO, the UN’s education arm, has released key
                                  recommendations from an independent Futures of Education
                                  Commission, which said: “It is an illusion to think that online
                                  learning is the way forward for all.” According to the
                                  commission, a shift towards remote, Web-based learning will
                                  deepen inequalities not just in the poor nations but also in the
                                  richer parts of the globe. Amitabh Kundu, distinguished fellow
                                  at the Research and Information System (RIS), a foreign
                                  ministry think tank, said the online mode makes education
                                  unequal, given the inequalities in households’ access to electronic
                                  gadgets. So, widespread online education would run counter to
                                  the ethos of education and the spirit of equality in the
                                  Constitution, he said.” (Mohanty, 2020).
                                    Trained Teachers
                                    The next challenge of equity relates to lack of trained
                                  teachers to teach online. Teachers teaching at any level of
                                  education are of various age groups; some at the verge of
                                  retirement may have never touched computer and may have

                                                                                      63]]></page><page Index="65"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  severe computer phobia; there may be another group who may
                                  be technology shy; others may be a group of digital migrant and
                                  young teachers may fall in another group of digital natives. So
                                  it is an important responsibility of the authority to minimize
                                  this divide of technology knowhow among the teachers and
                                  maintain technology knowledge equity among teachers.

                                    Conclusion
                                    The pandemic conditions made the institutions to go for
                                  alternative mode of Online teaching learning. But there are
                                  certain challenges of equity which need to be addressed if we
                                  are planning to continue Online Teaching learning. Online
                                  education is electronically supported learning that relies on the
                                  Internet for teacher/student interaction and the distribution of
                                  class materials. There must be a specific component in the
                                  education budget that looks at enabling online learning in the
                                  education system. This must focus on infrastructure creation,
                                  skill development initiatives and teacher training. Digital literacy
                                  must be prioritised from the primary school level onwards,
                                  especially in the case of girl students in rural India. Moreover,
                                  National Education Policy -2020 has a clear policy objective to
                                  promote online learning and integrating it into the education
                                  system for our transformation into a knowledge economy.

                                  communities around the world to rapidly  re-examine their
                                  approach to safe visitor engagement. In times when visitors can
                                  not come to interact with the physical exhibitions of all the
                                  museums, the museum personnel are thinking to regenerate
                                  some ideas on that how they must come to the visitors both in
                                  this present and post pandemic situation of the world. The
                                  present article focuses on the museum activities that have
                                  moved online in these closing weeks, both through streaming
                                  live events and through the creation of digital content and the
                                  proposal of visits that use virtual reality. The present study also
                                  highlights some major and user-friendly activities of Gandhi
                                  Memorial Museum, Barrackpore, through which an idea can be
                                  developed that how the museum personnel can plan to do while
                                  the COVID-19 pandemic is keeping visitors at home.

                                    Introduction:

                                    Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in late December 2019,
                                  has wreaked havoc across the world and like any critical sector,
                                  education has been hit hard. Students, schools, colleges and
                                  universities have been deeply impacted. According to the
                                  United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation
                                  (UNESCO), over 800 million learners from around the world
                                  have been affected, 1 in 5 learners cannot attend school, 1 in
                                  4 cannot attend higher education classes, and over 102 countries
                                  have ordered nationwide school closures while 11 have
                                  implemented localized school closure.
                                    Following the first-time identification of Coronavirus (Covid-
                                  19) in December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO)
                                  declared that Covid-19 is a global pandemic in March 2020 and
                                  warned about its highly contagious nature (WHO, 2020). As a
                                  precaution to slow down its spread, countries all around the
                                  world followed strict protocols such as complete or partial
                                  lockdowns, social distancing regulations and curfews. To reduce
                                  the chances of humans infecting each other with Covid-19,
                                  places where humans interact closely were shut down, including
                                  educational institutions. Accordingly, as an outcome of the
                                  measures taken worldwide, more than 1.5 billion enrolled
                                  students of all ages from all around the globe experienced
                                  interruption of education which equals nearly 90% of the
                                  global student population (UNESCO, 2020a; 2020b). Though
                                  the interruption of education has occurred previously in many
                                  local instances (e.g., in cases of war, civil unrest, famine or
                                  strikes) it is “being experienced more acutely and affectively by
                                  educators, students and parents” at a global scale for the first
                                  time (Williamson, Eynon & Potter, 2020, p. 107). Consequently,
                                  to ensure the continuity of education, emergency remote
                                  education was put in practice in varying delivery modes.
                                    In such a critical time, there has been a drastic change in
                                  how teaching and learning happen while learners are physically
                                  out of schools and separated from their teachers and co-

                                                                                      67]]></page><page Index="69"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  learners. The educational practices during the Covid-19
                                  pandemic are denoted with different terms in different countries
                                  (e.g., distance education, e-learning, online education,
                                  homeschooling, etc.). However, these terms do not quite capture
                                  what is being practiced during the interruption of education,
                                  which can better be described as Emergency Remote Education
                                  (ERE). Considering that the terms used in different countries
                                  are derivations of distance education, as a generic term, the
                                  remarkable difference between emergency remote education
                                  and distance education is that the latter is an option while the
                                  former is an obligation. Such an understanding is crucial
                                  because misconceptions in definitions would lead us to
                                  misconceptions in practices. Distance Education, for instance,
                                  is a planned activity and its implementation is grounded in
                                  theoretical and practical knowledge which is specific to the
                                  field and its nature. On the other hand, Emergency Remote
                                  Education is about surviving in a time of crisis with all
                                  resources available, including offline and/ or online.

                                    Distance education is defined as “any educational process
                                  in which all or most of the teaching is conducted by someone
                                  removed in space and/or time from the learner, with the effect
                                  that all or most of the communication between teachers and
                                  learners is through an artificial medium, either electronic or
                                  print” (UNESCO, 2002, p. 22). Nevertheless, it ‘is not simply
                                  a geographical separation of learners and teachers, but, more
                                  importantly, is a pedagogical concept’ (Moore, 1997, p. 22). In
                                  contrast, the crash nature of emergency remote education
                                  inevitably results in its weakness in theoretical underpinning
                                  and is far from being a pedagogical concept in its own right.

                                    The field of distance education has already proved its
                                  validity and value (Xiao, 2018) and earlier researches indicated
                                  that there is no difference between distance education and face
                                  to face education (Russell, 1999). Against widely known
                                  assumptions, distance education does not specifically refer to
                                  online education, but a wide range of technologies used


                                  68]]></page><page Index="70"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  throughout its generations (Jung, 2019; Moore & Kearsley,
                                  2012). The pragmatic nature of distance education allows the
                                  field to use working solutions for learners and defends the view
                                  that the field should provide educational opportunities for those
                                  who are “vulnerable to unequal developments” (Bozkurt, 2019,
                                  p. 510).
                                    While this is the case for the field of distance education, the
                                  World Bank (2020a) highlights that during the emergency
                                  remote education “failure is common, and success is often a
                                  result of experience and learning from past failures” (p. 1). The
                                  World Bank (2020b) further points out that:
                                    “education systems must confront issues of inequity
                                    front and center. They must also prepare multi-modal
                                    responses, capitalizing on existing infrastructure and
                                    utilizing a combination of different learning mediums to
                                    ensure students are engaged and learning. Emergency
                                    Remote Education can ensure that students continue
                                    learning through a variety of avenues. While digital
                                    technologies can offer a wide set of capabilities for
                                    remote learning, most education systems in low- and
                                    middle-income countries, including schools, children
                                    and/or teachers, lack access to high-speed broadband or
                                    digital devices needed to fully deploy online learning
                                    options. As such, education systems need to consider
                                    alternative ways for students to continue learning when
                                    they are not in school, like in the current Covid-19
                                    crisis” (p. 1).
                                    In this regard, it can be argued that, during the Covid-19
                                  pandemic, with similarities and differences (Bozkurt, & Sharma,
                                  2020), it was emergency remote education that was applied and
                                  it can be further argued that emergency remote education is a
                                  branch of distance education as in the case of online learning,
                                  e-learning, m-learning, or homeschooling.
                                    In search of an effective educational response to solve these
                                  emergent issues, countries must seek solutions beyond formal

                                                                                      69]]></page><page Index="71"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  education, by mobilizing and utilizing non-formal and informal
                                  learning resources in cooperation with partners across sectors.
                                  This is not only due to disrupted schooling, but also to the
                                  variety of learners and the diversity of their learning needs.
                                  Non-formal opportunities include a number of programmes
                                  implemented by diverse groups of stakeholders to respond to
                                  the learning needs emerging during the pandemic, with flexibility
                                  and open access.

                                    The formal educational institutes are not the only source of
                                  learning and knowledge where the prepared information given
                                  as education is an effective and interactive process. Different
                                  learning environments such as museums may ensure the
                                  permanence of the education taken by conversion of the
                                  institutional knowledge given by formal educational centres
                                  into activities. The importance of museums in education is
                                  emphasized by many theorists in the emergence of the concepts
                                  of efficiency in education, gaining experience, environment,
                                  interaction and constructivism; because the museum environment
                                  represents the extrovert and ideal place that can contribute to
                                  mental, physical, emotional, educational and social development
                                  of students by enabling them to practice and to experience.
                                  Museums help students to understand that they are members of
                                  that society and form the basis of personality and self-confidence
                                  construction by introducing the documents related to the culture
                                  within social interaction. Museums particularly in multicultural
                                  societies play an important role in integrating various groups
                                  together.
                                    Changing Role of Museums for Pandemic:
                                    As of today, all the museums of our country have taken
                                  precautions against the spread of COVID-19 to ensure the
                                  health of both their visitors and staff and they have been forced
                                  to temporary close their venues due to local outbreak or
                                  governmental orders. In times when visitors can not come to
                                  interact with the physical exhibitions of all the museums  so the
                                  museum personnel are thinking to regenerate some ideas on

                                  that how they must come to the visitors both in this present and
                                  post pandemic situation of the world.
                                    All over the world one wonders if during the transition
                                  phase and subsequently, at the end of the pandemic, the cultural
                                  fruition will return to be similar to the previous one or changes
                                  can be hypothesized. The present article focuses on the museum
                                  activities that have moved online in these closing weeks, both
                                  through streaming live events and through the creation of
                                  digital content and the proposal of visits that use virtual reality.
                                  One way to connect with the public despite social distancing is
                                  to invite them to visit the museum virtually. Museums around
                                  the world have been adding virtual collections for some years
                                  now.
                                    We all know that museums and exhibitions were synonymous
                                  for many centuries with physical spaces in which artifacts were
                                  displayed at a safe distance to their visitors. After the introduction
                                  of information and communication technologies, these physical
                                  exhibitions have taken the shape of online or virtual exhibitions,
                                  which are much more economical and useful to both exhibitors
                                  and visitors. Day by day new tools, techniques and technologies
                                  are introduced and they are helping the designers to produce
                                  much more attractive, useful and educative online exhibitions
                                  that are able to give almost the same feeling or experience to
                                  the visitors.
                                    Online exhibition is an exhibition event which can be
                                  viewed right on personal computers or mobile phones using
                                  Internet or GPRS anywhere, any place and any time. It is the
                                  best way of disseminating information in digital form including
                                  exhibiting products, artifacts, and educating visitors on any
                                  topic.

                                  physical objects in a museum or exhibition.
                                    Google Arts and Culture has collaborated with more than
                                  500 museums and galleries across the globe to provide virtual

                                    Initiative of Gandhi Memorial Museum, Barrackpore
                                  for Adapting Interactive Experiences:

                                    The present study highlights some major and user-friendly
                                  activities of a museum of West Bengal, entitled Gandhi Memorial
                                  Museum, Barrackpore, through which an idea can be developed
                                  that how the museum personnel can plan to do while the
                                  COVID-19 pandemic is keeping visitors at home. The Gandhi
                                  Memorial Museum for the Eastern Region came up at
                                  Barrackpore in the year 1961 and it was thrown open to the
                                  public on the 7 th  May, 1966. The objectives are to collect,
                                  preserve and display materials connected with the memory of
                                  the Mahatma, disseminate his life, thoughts, activities and
                                  programmes for public benefit through different museum
                                  processes. This museum is a Biographical Museum which has
                                  a distinct role to develop the right attitude and approach to life,
                                  living and relations apart from the inspiration. The distinct
                                  potentiality that marks out such museums is their capability to
                                  work for the uplift of the fellow beings, both in developing
                                  their human character and broadening their education and
                                  culture. In times of moral degradation and absence of moral
                                  values in public life museums on such type of our country or
                                  the whole world will rescue us from our predicament. So such
                                  a museum on noble people of our country or the whole world
                                  has great responsibilities in our community or public life.
                                    l Gandhi Memorial Museum, Barrackpore already offers
                                       360-degree views of the exhibits of one gallery in their
                                       website, so that visitors can learn about everything of
                                       this gallery from the comfort of home and the museum

                                       remaining galleries of the museum during post pandemic
                                       phase.
                                    l The museum is sharing their exhibits and research works
                                       through the eyes of a sworn enthusiast. On their social
                                       media they are sharing the post short movies of
                                       researchers or educators talking about their favourite
                                       things. In this way the museum community gets exclusive
                                       thoughts from people working behind the scenes. From
                                       such type of activity the museum expects that it would
                                       certainly stir up the visitors’ interest in topics they did
                                       not know could be fascinating.
                                    l The museum community is also active on Twitter in
                                       order to reach those who are social distancing. The
                                       Gandhi Memorial Museum is now tweeting  interesting
                                       facts, videos and insights about their collections at
                                       present.
                                    l Presently the museum invites their audience to join in on
                                       the process of creating content for their social media
                                       channels for the engagement of the visitors with the
                                       museum and the museum follows several ways for
                                       progressing such activities -
                                       o They ask their audiences to share stories and
                                          memorable experiences from visits and these stories
                                          are uploaded in their social media to encourage others
                                          to share their treasured moments.
                                       o To encourage children and their parents the museum
                                          has developed a plan to try out a series of quizzes
                                          related to the Freedom Movement and life and activities
                                          of Mahatma Gandhi at home and ask them to post the
                                          results. Such activity may be a good combination of
                                          education and engagement in post pandemic period.

                                    l It is also a great experiment for this museum to share
                                       their galleries through live streaming guided tours and


                                                                                      73]]></page><page Index="75"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                       shows daily such live videos through their virtual media.
                                       The live video feature on Facebook is easy to use and
                                       people can ask questions directly in a chat. If we want
                                       to give people the opportunity to actively participate in
                                       a topic they care for; we can post a schedule. It could be
                                       a good idea to save these videos on a platform where
                                       they can be seen afterwards. We want people to come
                                       and experience our exhibition for them.
                                    l Today Museums across the globe also use YouTube to
                                       connect with and engage their visitors. There is a huge
                                       range of interesting videos to take advantage of while
                                       social distancing. Many museums are currently sharing
                                       links to these through their social media channels. We
                                       are also planning to create the YouTube channel for our
                                       museum, where visitors can watch the videos, either
                                       which we had showed in our museum’s audio-visual
                                       room or the video of any event or programmes of our
                                       museum.
                                    l The museum has taken an immersive Virtual Experience
                                       Building initiative for the students through their virtual
                                       medium. This activity provides the opportunities for the
                                       students to engage with various activities of the museum,
                                       such as virtual visit of different galleries of the museum,
                                       film shows on the historical events of our Freedom
                                       Movement, interactive presentation on the awareness of
                                       climatic changes and the audio-visual spot quiz on the
                                       life and activities of Mahatma Gandhi. Three days online
                                       live programmes are conducting with the group of students
                                       in a particular institution in a week.
                                    l Today museums have to rethink and plan radical choices
                                       that take into account the logic of accountability of the
                                       increasingly important  social responsibility  they have
                                       towards society as a whole. As a biographical museum,
                                       based on life and activities of our ‘Father of the Nation’
                                       – Mahtma Gandhi, we have to keep in our mind that we

                                       should highlight the message to the public that Gandhiji’s
                                       principle could be very relevant here as it stressed on
                                       self-reliance at the local level. Mahatma Gandhi’s concept
                                       of Gram Swaraj can be interpreted and appreciated in the
                                       light of the coronavirus pandemic. So we are also
                                       planning to arrange some series of lectures by the
                                       experts and to make some small video clippings and
                                       interactive resources to motivate the people.
                                    Conclusion
                                    The implementation of lifelong learning for all may be the
                                  key characteristic of effective local educational responses to the
                                  pandemic. Non-formal and informal learning initiatives –
                                  focusing on collaborative and inclusive use of information
                                  communication technologies (ICTs) have an advantage when
                                  responding to emergent learning needs in a timely manner.
                                  Their effectiveness lies in their age, gender, linguistic and
                                  cultural sensitivity. They can meet the specific and multi-
                                  faceted needs of many different groups flexibly. The COVID-
                                  19 crisis has resulted in a remarkable technological boom when
                                  it comes to supporting continuity of learning and education.
                                  ICTs have widened access to learning materials, enhancing the
                                  flexibility of time and place and meeting learners’ needs (UIL,
                                  2020). This ‘sudden digital boom’ may motivate to explore the
                                  potential of ICTs to digitize education and other public services
                                  further once the crisis has ended. Government-led initiatives
                                  that use ICTs to enhance learning and education should be
                                  collaborative and cross-sectoral to harness the existing
                                  technological resources and learning expertise in the private
                                  and voluntary sectors. Issues such as online safety and unequal
                                  access, among others, need to be addressed so that targeted
                                  policy intervention for digital inclusion can ensure that no-one
                                  is left behind.
                                    The pandemic has allowed us to recognize and demonstrate
                                  the value of non-formal and informal learning. As the informal
                                  learning centre all the museums now can thrive on what they

                                                                                      75]]></page><page Index="77"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  achieve during the crisis and benefit from the momentum that
                                  follows by continuing to place importance on informal learning
                                  and promoting lifelong learning for all. The museums that
                                  embark on this route should firstly engage different stakeholders
                                  in discussing a comprehensive local lifelong learning vision.
                                  This vision could be conveyed by adopting a learning charter
                                  to guide stakeholder involvement and contribution. The good
                                  practice of one informal learning centre like museum can
                                  spread and be scaled up to lead to a country-wide initiative,
                                  with the support of the government, including special provisions
                                  related to COVID-19.

                                  Abstract:

                                  The use of technology is no longer an option, it is a requirement
                                  now. In the past few years we have seen that digital technology
                                  is used in teaching-learning process to enhance the quality in
                                  terms of improvements of education system and so as in
                                  language learning. All these technologies are designed to
                                  empower the learners and also the teachers by developing their
                                  skills. In language learning use of technology can enhance four
                                  skills i.e. reading, writing, speaking and listening. A bunch of
                                  technological equipments are in vogue to develop the aforesaid
                                  skills in learner such as CALL  (Computer-Assisted Language
                                  Learning), VSTF (Visual-Syntactic Text Formatting), CMC
                                  (Computer Mediated Communication), education purposes
                                  online games, social sites and many more. Computer based
                                  classrooms are more effective for development of language
                                  learning skills than a face to face learning classroom in many
                                  ways than one. Technology supported classrooms make things
                                  easier and more accessible to the learners. The present study

                                    Introduction
                                    There exists a unanimous notion about 21 st  century as the
                                  precursor of tech-driven society. Today technology leaves its
                                  citable imprints on every aspect of the lives of global citizenry.
                                  Education is the one such factor where the impact of technology
                                  can be seen widely (Budhwar, 2017). Various types of software
                                  and gadgets are making the conventional education system
                                  more accessible and joyful to the learners. The word ‘technology’
                                  is derived from the Greek words ‘technic’ meaning art or skill
                                  and ‘logia’  meaning science or study. Thus etymologically
                                  technology is said to be the science or study of an art or skill.
                                  Technology is a potent tool to fulfill some educational objectives
                                  and thereby usher in a change in social spectra. When technology
                                  is used in this purpose it is called educational technology
                                  (Aggarwal, 2014). This is used to improve the quality of
                                  education process and to empower students conceptually. In a
                                  technology equipped classroom a teacher can easily explain or
                                  demonstrate his lessons, can give examples or show images,
                                  videos, graphics etc.
                                    Education is a process of acquiring knowledge, skills and
                                  habits and these knowledge, skills are transferred from one
                                  generation to next generation through teaching and learning.
                                  Over the last few decades a major change has taken place in
                                  education as the use of technology is becoming more important
                                  in delevering education to learners and learning (Kilickaya &
                                  Seferoglu, 2013). Undoubtedly language learning is its part and
                                  parcel. This is a process of formal or self- study programme. As
                                  every facet of education is influenced by technology, language


                                                                                      79]]></page><page Index="81"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  learning is no exception. Language teaching-learning has been
                                  drastically changing over the years by the augmentative use of
                                  technology. Technology is a major key for linguistic change
                                  (Shyamlee, 2012). Judicious use of science and technology in
                                  language teaching-learning can make it more easy and flexible.
                                  Having computer in a language classroom is an asset to the
                                  teacher and the learner both.
                                    Language teaching-learning has undergone a remarkable
                                  transformation in recent years. Few years back there were only
                                  the classrooms and textbooks as the tools of language learning
                                  for the learners but in present epoch computer and other web
                                  based tools are very much used by the teacher and learner both
                                  for the improvement of learning (Richards, 2015). Various
                                  multimedia technologies such as audio, visual, animation effects
                                  play a major role in language teaching-learning. Especially in
                                  second language teaching Computer-Assisted Language Learning
                                  (CALL) is now most demanded application of technology
                                  involving simulations, electronic communication and multimedia
                                  production (Warschauer, 2002). Another important tool for
                                  language learning is Automated Writing Evaluation which
                                  evaluates and analyzes texts or writings. Or a new approach to
                                  computer-supported reading is Visual-Syntactic Text Formatting
                                  (VSTF) by which we can change text’s font size, style,
                                  background, page colour, layout etc. Technology such as
                                  discussion forums, social networking sites and online games
                                  which provide students different kind of environment for
                                  language learning (Simpson, 2011). In language teaching there
                                  are mainly four skills to develop in learners’ attitude, those are
                                  listening, speaking, reading and writing- as of paramount
                                  importance.
                                    Listening is a major component in language learning. Through
                                  listening we gather information which helps us in produce
                                  language (Brown, 2000). Listening for educational purposes is
                                  very much necessary to grasp a texts or a theory. Second skill
                                  is speaking. Sometimes speaking and listening are used as same

                                  meaning as they are closely intertwined. The duo helps students
                                  to gather ideas and enrich their knowledge domain. Next comes
                                  reading skill. This skill can be well developed through the
                                  association of writing, listening and speaking activities (Brown,
                                  2000). Another powerful means of learning is writing. Writing
                                  helps students to describe their thoughts in a specific way. Also
                                  non-verbal (gestures-postures, facial expression) and various
                                  verbal communications like images, drawings, graphics etc.
                                  also favour to consummate the entire process.
                                    Importance of Language Learning:

                                    1) To communicate with each other language is most
                                       important tool.

                                    2) To understand various situations or problems.
                                    3) Gain experience.
                                    4) To know about society and culture.
                                    5) To enrich students intellectually or educationally.

                                    Need of Technology in Language Learning:
                                    1) To cultivate students interest in learning.

                                    2) To improve various skills of the learner.
                                    3) Development of efficiency.
                                    4) It makes the class interesting.
                                    5) Helps students to clarify their language related doubts.

                                    6) To widen students’  knowledge.
                                    Application of Technology in Language Learning:
                                    The four language learning skills are listening, speaking,
                                  reading and writing are briefly described here.
                                    ü Speaking and Listening Skill:  These two major skills
                                       are closely interrelated with each other. Oral


                                                                                      81]]></page><page Index="83"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                       communication can be described well by these two
                                       skills. Through listening and speaking people share their
                                       thoughts, feeling and ideas with each other. In a learning
                                       situation students can share their problems or thoughts to
                                       others and they can solve their doubts by using these two
                                       skills of language learning.

                                    ü Reading Skill:  This language skill is best developed
                                       with the association of writing, listening and speaking
                                       skill (Brown, 2000).
                                    ü Writing Skill: Another means of powerful communication
                                       is writing. Writing skill enables students to gain
                                       experiences and development of understanding level.
                                       Students can express their thoughts in a linguistic manner.
                                    In the modern world most studies are promoting technology-
                                  based language education (Tawil, 2019). Thus, various
                                  multimedia tools such as radio, television, film, tape recorder,
                                  computers etc. have all played their significant role in language
                                  learning. Rapid use of information and communication
                                  technology people can contact with each other over the world
                                  through these media in faster and easier manner. These digital
                                  technologies can be categorized mainly in three metaphors,
                                  computer as tutor, as a tool and medium (Simpson, 2011). It
                                  is a tutor when it is providing, analyze and present material
                                  such as grammar, vocabulary, and practices exercises relating
                                  to language learning. Computer is a tool when students are
                                  using computer for their learning purpose. And lastly this is a
                                  medium, emphasizes on communication process.
                                    In this globalization era the world has seen significant
                                  technological advancement in language teaching-learning
                                  process. Technologies which are specifically used for language-
                                  learning are mentioned below.

                                    ü Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL): This
                                       is an approach to teaching and learning in which materials
                                       are given to the students through computer. This approach

                                  82]]></page><page Index="84"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                       is associated with speech technology. Speech recognition,
                                       synthesis and speech signals can be visualized by this
                                       application. In case of writing through this approach
                                       learners can receives feedback on their writing. They can
                                       find synonyms, antonyms of any word or they can
                                       translate sentences. The range of possibilities of language
                                       learning has been expanding by this approach.
                                    ü Visual-Syntactic Text Formatting (VSTF): This digital
                                       approach enhances reading skill by the development of
                                       three critical components of reading. Those are, word
                                       recognition (phonological decoding), language
                                       comprehension and text interpretation (Thomas et al.,
                                       2013). Language comprehension skill can be developed
                                       by use of various computer-assisted tools such as
                                       electronic dictionaries, corpus analysis, online word lists
                                       etc. Text interpretation means understanding of text
                                       genres, structure, formality and other component of
                                       language. Computer-assisted reading materials help the
                                       learners to acquire these skills. VSTF helps in
                                       development of reading skill by breaking sentences in
                                       clauses or phrases so that students can understand the
                                       texts or the theory.
                                    ü Automated Writing Evaluation (AWE):      This is a
                                       scoring system which evaluates, analyzes and combines
                                       writings based on language recognition technologies and
                                       statistical procedures. Besides this, there are other scoring
                                       engines such as Educational Testing Service (ETS),
                                       Project Essay Grade (PEG) and Bayesian Essay Test
                                       Scoring System (BETSY) etc. Automated Writing
                                       Evaluation helps students in improving their writing skill
                                       in digital mode.
                                    ü Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR):     Automatic
                                       speech recognition deals with those words or phrases
                                       which are commonly used with the family members or
                                       other persons.

                                       communication done through electronic medium. This
                                       process can be divided into two forms, synchronous or
                                       real  time   communication    and  asynchronous
                                       communication. Real time communication uses various
                                       tools like adobe connect, blackboard collaborate, skype,
                                       zoom. These applications allow learners to exchange
                                       their videos, images and texts (Blake, 2016).
                                    ü Speech Recognition (SR):   Recent developments in
                                       speech technology can create an interaction between a
                                       human and a computer through which a person can share
                                       or transfer directly his thoughts to a machine (Holland &
                                       Fisher, 2007). It is a process of decoding oral speech and
                                       it also provides feedback. It helps in developing speaking
                                       skill of the learners. This technology combined with
                                       Automatic Correction and Feedback (ACF) so that
                                       learners can solve their doubts and can develop their
                                       pronunciation skill (Shadiev & Yang, 2020).

                                       they can also practice their skill here with the other
                                       students.
                                    ü Corpus:   Corpus has a wide range of speeches,
                                       conversations, texts etc. so that students use to study and
                                       describe a language.

                                    ü Pod Casting:  This audio format helps the students to
                                       recognize a language or understand it and also helps
                                       them in speaking.
                                    ü Quicktionary:  It is a pen-like device which allows the
                                       reader to scan and translate the texts.
                                    ü Social Networking: Various social networking sites help
                                       the language learner to adopt a new language or they can
                                       share their own language with the others in worldwide.
                                       Thus they can build their own language identity and can
                                       develop their language skills.
                                    Conclusion
                                    Technology equipped language teaching-leaning class makes
                                  the teachers and the learners autonomous, creative and more
                                  productive by developing their inner potentialities. It is cost
                                  efficienty, easy and authentic way of learning where learners
                                  can learn at their own paces. Learners could make choices and
                                  a collaborative attitude can be developed into their mind.
                                  Though there exists a number of potential challenges in web
                                  based or digitalized language learning mode, say lack of
                                  technology skills of the learner or his unpreparedness for
                                  interacting with others. But in this era of CALL we should keep
                                  in mind that learners are the central of teaching-learning
                                  process. So we have to pay attention that education through
                                  computer should not be mechanical rather it should be more
                                  aesthetic and learner centered. Therefore we have to try for a
                                  judicious union of man and machine oriented learning. If
                                  human can imbibe the newly developed artificial intelligence,
                                  language learning process will lead us towards a new welcome
                                  synthesis.

                                  Abstract
                                  Pandemic situation in second week of March, 2020 in India and
                                  in many other countries even before it entered India was really
                                  serious. Now in the wake of another deadly variant namely
                                  Omicron our struggle has entered a new phase to protect lives
                                  of our people and simultaneously to reopen hitherto closed
                                  institutions for reverting back to normalcy. In such situations it
                                  becomes obligatory for government to take major decisions and
                                  continuously monitor the situation so that health protocol like
                                  social distancing, sanitization, testing and precaution doses..
                                  Since the educational institutes and entertainment sector are
                                  reopening, people are being sensitized continually to follow the
                                  protective measures according to the government instructions.
                                  However, during this pandemic situation there are number of
                                  challenges for government like arrangement of health facilities,
                                  maintaining economy, meeting the needs of people through
                                  subsidized PDS and above all the major concern in front of
                                  government is education of children. So the veteran educationists
                                  came forward with the option of online education. Schools
                                  have started catering online education to the young learners.

                                  Teachers are also working hard to adapt to the changed milieu
                                  to perform their role in e-education of their students. Everything
                                  is running like a school system though it has its own pros and
                                  cons, i.e. certain limitations are there. As we know education
                                  and technology are like two sides of a coin in today’s world. So
                                  technology is playing its best role for children so that they
                                  could continue their education during this pandemic situation
                                  named COVID-19.
                                    Key words: teaching and learning, integrating ICT,

                                    Introduction

                                    Education is one of the key means for developing nations to
                                  achieve repid chage in a global world characterised by
                                  information and communication tools. The word ‘Internet’
                                  enters our life world at early morning and continues till late
                                  night. Thus today internet is working as life partner for a large
                                  number of people helping them not only in personal business
                                  but also in the sphere of professional lives. Mainly for
                                  educational purpose, it is widely used to gather information and
                                  to improve the academic excellence in different fields. Now
                                  more tham before New innovation and creative thoughts have
                                  been widely used and shared in global platform with the help
                                  of internet.

                                    Some kinds of Online-learning Applications
                                    E-Examination: In this application, students are administered
                                  many proof exams in the internet environment before the
                                  formal exams, which enables them to determine their
                                  approximate levels.
                                    E-Drills: With the internet based drill software, it is aimed
                                  to create an effective and productive studying atmosphere for
                                  students. As students access these activities on the internet,
                                  they could study on the units through interactive multimedia
                                  software and reinforce their knowledge by examining numerous
                                  examples.

                                                                                      89]]></page><page Index="91"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                    E-Book and E-Television: In order to enable the students
                                  to access the books and TV  programs on the internet the
                                  contents of the course books and TV programs can be presented
                                  as E – book and E-television. Therefore a student of the system
                                  can easily access the books and TV  programs as well.
                                    E- Counseling Academic counseling: It could provide to
                                  the students in a similar format on the internet. Parallel to the
                                  research software students are allowed to ask questions to their
                                  academic counselors related to their course contents.
                                    E– Sound Book: This enables especially the visually retarded
                                  students to listen to the course book contents and could be
                                  provided on the internet. Therefore, visually retarded students
                                  and students with reading difficulties could access their course
                                  books from their respective sources.

                                    Applications that can help the teacher and students to
                                  communicate effectively for  teaching learning process
                                    Zoom  is a video-calling app that is ideal for large groups
                                  because it supports up to 100 users for free. It is widely being
                                  used for meetings, online learning, and university lectures,
                                  among other things. The app has become immensely popular as
                                  people have been forced to stay indoors due to the lockdown.
                                  The free version of Zoom allows users to enjoy unlimited 1-on-

                                    Google Meet is a videoconferencing service to anybody
                                  who wants to use it, instead of just offering it to enterprise and
                                  education customers via G Suite. Google Meet is a video-
                                  conference-calling platform designed primarily for professional
                                  use, which links remote colleagues together for real-time
                                  interaction. On a basic Google Meet call, up to 25 people can
                                  speak and share video with each other at once. If you subscribe

                                  who can join a call goes up to 50 or 100.
                                    l You need a paid G Suite account in order to set up and
                                       start Google Meet video conferences, but anyone with a
                                       standard Google account can join and participate in a
                                       Google Meet session.
                                    No doubt ICT plays an important role in the field of
                                  education in every step of teaching learning process. Students
                                  will use the different search engine like Google, Yahoo etc.

                                  which is preferred by mostly everyone. Importance of
                                  Information and Communication Technology for professional
                                  and non professional are given below:
                                    l  Cost Effective and Affordable Education
                                    One of the largest barriers to education is high cost, which
                                  is not affordable for weaker section of the people living in our
                                  society. But this bridge gap between the learner and reader can
                                  be filk with the help of new modern technology.

                                    l  Easy accessible through the Worldwide

                                    Learner can easily access the required material which is
                                  essential for academic excellence. Students clear their doubts
                                  with the help of tutorial videos on different platforms. Teacher
                                  can record the lectures and provide it to the students for
                                  revision according to their own timetable and reading efficiency.
                                    l  Stands with era and technology
                                    For a good livelihood it is necessary to update with new
                                  technology and scenario in our society. There is a huge amount
                                  of information available for every subject. Information and
                                  communication technology enables every individual to update
                                  himself\herself with the latest information regarding the subject
                                  in which they want to upgrade with new innovation ideas.
                                    l Flexibility for students: In traditional classrooms
                                       students has to go to school on proper time and they
                                       have to attend various classes one after other without
                                       any or one break. It was quite boring for kids to learn the
                                       thing one after other. But now there is a bit change in
                                       situation and they are getting online classes which are
                                       also being recorded and hence they can take rest in
                                       between and can enjoy this flexibility for refreshing their
                                       minds from traditional strict classroom to a flexible
                                       classroom. So students are learning the things at their
                                       own pace and at their own timing. Students are able to
                                       learn the things and attend the online class again and
                                       again which was not possible in traditional education as
                                       the class is taken once of a particular topic by teacher
                                       which is generally not recorded. So students can take
                                       advantage of listening to the class lecture again and
                                       again.
                                    l Better   interaction opportunities:  Students get
                                       opportunities of interaction with all their classmates as
                                       well teachers one on one. In traditional classrooms
                                       students generally have one or two friends but in these

                                       online classes students get to know each other better
                                       than before. Students becomes confident about their skill
                                       of interaction and they can ask any question without any
                                       hesitation as it is sometimes becomes difficult for student
                                       to ask anything in front of whole class. So we can easily
                                       say that online classes after better interaction opportunities
                                       to students with teachers. During face to face learning
                                       some students who are not very active are not able to
                                       clear their doubts but during online education they can
                                       ask anything through live message.
                                    l Reduced costs: During traditional classes there are lots
                                       of expenses that have to be mat by parents like transport
                                       cost. In addition to this a lot of other expenses was there.
                                       But after lockdown period they are studying at home and
                                       hence expenses are less. Students are at home and still
                                       learning the same things through online classes with
                                       reduced cost. It is helping the parents in managing their
                                       budgets as daily expenses are shooting up and income
                                       has decreased in this pandemic situation. So reduced
                                       cost of education can help a lot of people in continuing
                                       their kid’s education.
                                    l Personal attention: Each and every student is having
                                       their own kind of interaction with teachers in their
                                       comfortable zone and teacher is also able to pay full
                                       attention to each and every kid. Personal attention
                                       increases their concentration and hence result gets
                                       improved. Teachers are replying to the questions of
                                       students individually. During online classes students can
                                       ask anything without any fear. Students are learning the
                                       things and can ask their doubt whenever they want to as
                                       teachers are available online for whole day so it is
                                       increasing the personal attention of teacher on every
                                       student.
                                    l Teacher’s benefit: Teachers are also getting benefit
                                       because of these online classes as they are getting more

                                                                                      93]]></page><page Index="95"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                       conscious about their teaching and teaching skills.
                                       Teachers are doing their work perfectly as the ambience
                                       of teaching is different and they are being observed by
                                       not only students but their families also. Their hard work
                                       will be very helpful for students in learning at their own
                                       pace. Teachers are learning a lot of new things also.
                                       Traditional teachers who were not very much aware of
                                       technology are giving live lectures and hence they are
                                       getting updated of new technology use which may make
                                       their work easy in future.
                                    l Fast learning: Online learning is a bit fast way of
                                       learning. In traditional classrooms settings it takes a lot
                                       of time and students are found to indulge in talking and
                                       doing naughty things in class. They get tired very soon
                                       but in online classes they attend the classes and do not
                                       get indulged in other activities and pays full attention on
                                       lectures and hence the learning is on fast track. Students
                                       are not able to interact with each other. They are at their
                                       homes and parents are also keeping an eye on them; so
                                       they are more attentive towards study and learning on a
                                       fast mode than before.
                                    Opportunities of Online learning
                                    During the pandemic situation of 2020-21 it is quite
                                  challenging for school administration, teachers, students and
                                  parents to perform each and everything through online medium.
                                  But still we can easily find out the opportunities and benefits
                                  of this online education. If there was no option of teaching
                                  online then there would have been a huge loss of education of
                                  all the kids Still we don’t know when the situation of pandemic
                                  disease will be over. Cases have started to increas again. So it
                                  was really important to continue the education of our children.
                                  Hence we can easily say that online education is helpful in
                                  continuing our education. Children are not out of touch of their
                                  studies. They are even learning various new things. They are
                                  getting updated with new technology as well as they are

                                  94]]></page><page Index="96"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  becoming technologically aware. Same is in case of teachers,
                                  they are learning a lot of new things and methods during online
                                  teaching. There were some teachers who were not aware of
                                  technology before this situation but now they are also being
                                  involved in online teaching. So here we may discuss about
                                  various opportunities of online education

                                    l Safe and secure: Students are continuing their school
                                       through online education and hence they are studying at
                                       home. So it is really safe and secure for kids as they are
                                       learning at home without any fear of infection of such a
                                       pandemic disease. It is also benefitting the society as
                                       teachers as well as students are secure and safe at home
                                       and teaching learning process is going on at the same
                                       pace as it as earlier.
                                    l Parents are tension free: Online education has also
                                       helped parents in removing their tension about study of
                                       their children. It is tough to cope up with the present
                                       situation. Parents do not want to send their children
                                       anywhere and also they don’t want their child to lag
                                       behind in studies. So online education has provided
                                       them the best option for their child’s study. They have
                                       become tension free for education of their kids.
                                    l Enhanced role of technology: As we know technology
                                       plays an important role in our lives now a days. So
                                       online education has also helped in expanding the use of
                                       technology at homes. Parents as well as teachers who
                                       were not aware of technology are getting more updated
                                       even in remote areas due to this online education. Hence
                                       we can easily observe the importance and benefit of
                                       online education.
                                    Challenges of Online learning

                                    As we know each and everything in this world has its own
                                  benefits and limitations likewise technology is no exception to
                                  this saying. It helped a lot in this pandemic situation and also

                                                                                      95]]></page><page Index="97"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  helping in continuing the education of children. But it can be
                                  easily observed that online classes are not the promising
                                  educational opportunities they are made out to be. Many
                                  students are just finishing the course and not paying that much
                                  attention which needs for a particular class. It has been found
                                  that there are many threats which are being aroused because of
                                  this online education system. Let us discuss some of them here:
                                    l Lack of willingness and desire: Students are not willing
                                       to attend the classes at home and especially it is very
                                       difficult to arose the desire of attending the class online
                                       in small kids. Students are not motivated for attending
                                       the classes online and avoiding the important things
                                       which need to be learned in the given particular time.
                                       Students are not enthusiastic about attending the class
                                       and it is creating boredom. So it is a threat that they may
                                       get bored of attending the live classes even and distance
                                       is getting increased between teacher and student.

                                    l Overburdening of teacher as well as students: Due to
                                       this online education system teachers are overburdened
                                       as they have to prepare a lot for teaching online.
                                       Students as well parents are also complaining about too
                                       much workload on kids. Students are not able to learn
                                       the things properly at home. Teachers can only teach
                                       online and hence students are not in complete touch of
                                       teachers which results in lack of discipline, punctuality
                                       and sincerity in kids.

                                    l Lack of punctuality: Teachers are taking live classes
                                       and students have to attend these classes at a particular
                                       time as per decided by the school management. But
                                       students are not attending the classes on proper time as
                                       they do not wake up early and sometimes they do not
                                       want to attend the class on time as there is no restriction
                                       on them like time table so they are careless for the
                                       timing at home. Hence there is the threat of carelessness
                                       and lack of punctuality in students in future.

                                    l Lack of relationship: There is no direct or personal
                                       interaction between student and teacher. Online education
                                       is making the kids a bit practical and unemotional also.
                                       It is decreasing the interpersonal relationship and respect
                                       that exists between teacher and student. There is little or
                                       hardly any interaction of classmates so it is also affecting
                                       the social interaction of kids with each other. So it is
                                       threatening the teacher student relationship and harmony.
                                    l Lack of motivation: Students are not in contact of each
                                       other and they hardly interact with each other. During
                                       online education it is not possible to make groups or
                                       forming relationships with their peers. Students are not
                                       getting any opportunity to make new friends. Most of the
                                       communication is between teacher and student so there
                                       is no feeling of competition and there is huge lack of
                                       motivation in students especially small kids who always
                                       learn through imitating each other.
                                    l Internet facility and technology: There are a lot of
                                       parents who are not aware of technology. So the students
                                       who lives in remote areas and do not have internet
                                       facility or android mobiles and laptop are not able to
                                       attend the online classes. Hence these students will not
                                       be able to continue their study during this pandemic
                                       situation. So there is threat of forgetfulness of previous
                                       study completely because we still don’t know when the
                                       schools will reopen. So these students are at great loss.
                                       l Misconception about the internet and its usefulness:
                                          Basically in developing countries, people can use the
                                          internet site for social networking. So the large number
                                          of people believe that if you promote the digital
                                          gadgets it can be used for negative purposes.
                                       l Connectivity: Most of students, teachers and educators
                                          say that, it is the speed of the connection that is the
                                          major bottleneck. Connectivity also affects where the

                                                                                      97]]></page><page Index="99"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                         students access the internet. Students without internet
                                         can’t connect with teachers or classmates. Information
                                         idea can be shared only with high speed network.
                                       l Language problem or     localization of content:
                                         Basically in our country three language formula is
                                         working, in which, the other language is more
                                         preferred. Usually large number of language material
                                         or contents are available in English languages. Because
                                         the English language is supposed to be the universal
                                         language. The program is running in English which is
                                         not the native tongue of the students. As a result lots
                                         of students donot find interest in studies. Language
                                         makes the boundary between learner and information
                                         provider.
                                       l Infrastructure of Social Education System: Learner
                                         are incapable to use the modern and advanced
                                         technology, basically in rural parts of India. They are
                                         unable to operate and hard to get the online education
                                         system in their lifestyle.
                                       l Attitudes of parents towards E-learning: Most of
                                         educated or literally educated families and parents
                                         don’t have positive attitudes towards E-learning.
                                         Parents think that, their child uses the internet as a
                                         social media for chatting and socializing, watching
                                         movies and listening to music. This simply causes
                                         wastge of time or delays in school work submission.
                                         As a result poor academic result. Parents believe that
                                         school dodging in an evil effect associated with the
                                         internet used among secondary school students.
                                       l Lack of speed of Web Band: Despite the large
                                         number of internet users in developing country like
                                         India the level of the network used in rural area is 2G,
                                         3G network. When the speed of the internet is too
                                         poor; we can not think about the online classes.

                                       l Lack of motivation towards the modern technology:
                                          The internet penetration level stands at just 40% to
                                          42% in India. People are unable to easily accept the
                                          modern technology due to safety norms and negative
                                          advertisement. Both central and state governments
                                          don’t provide the sufficient aid to promote the
                                          importance of modern technology in a global world.
                                       l Inefficiency of Teachers and Teacher  Educator:
                                          Still now around 40% of our teacher and teacher
                                          educators are incapable to use the modern gadgets
                                          and technology, which is necessary to operate the
                                          online classes and discussion. The teachers and teacher
                                          educators have lack of clear understanding as what to
                                          teach and how to teach with the help of modern
                                          technology and application. This is due to lack of
                                          literacy about the computer and modern advance
                                          apps.
                                       l Access issue: There are roughly 5.5 million households
                                          with school age children, who don’t have broadband
                                          internet access at home. This means millions of
                                          students are being left behind the service. The
                                          infrastructure problem concerns those living in rural
                                          areas, where the internet is available with bandwidth
                                          problems.

                                    Recommendation:
                                    The curriculum should give more focus on the Information
                                  and communication technology. Government should focus more
                                  on implementation rather than launching numerous programme.
                                  The government need to organize different ICT  programs
                                  properly so that the society can easily accept the new technology
                                  and its importance. Training, workshop may be organized at
                                  regular or short interval of time basically in rural areas of the
                                  country. Thus, teachers and teacher educators would be trained
                                  and oriented to scale up their efficiency and alsoto promote
                                  their self-esteem. There should be a quick response mechanism

                                  areas. Every individual should be empowered by augmenting
                                  their skills, understanding creativity and access to information
                                  technology equally in rural and urban region. Digital India is
                                  not a mere slogan, rather the Central government must encourage
                                  good governance through e-governance and more participatory
                                  process. In this comprehensive scheme ICT is the most important
                                  strategic component.
                                    Conclusion
                                    We may easily conclude from the above discussion that
                                  COVID-19 has hit hard everything in our country and education
                                  is no exception. Almost 1.53 billion learners are out of school
                                  and all the schools are closed for a longer period than expected.
                                  Dropout rates across the globe are likely to increase as a result
                                  of this massive disruption to education access. As we know that
                                  education is now the day is as important as health, water and
                                  sanitation so its needs cannot be forgotten and it has an equally
                                  detrimental impact if left unaddressed. Interruptions to education
                                  during this pandemic situation can have long term implications.
                                  There is a real risk for weak learners. Without access to
                                  education, as shocks are experienced including loss of life,
                                  health impacts and loss of livelihood children are more
                                  unprotected and vulnerable. As households finances are being
                                  decreased and everyone is in stress so children are likely to
                                  exposed to risks like facing anger of elders at home, moving
                                  freely without any work and getting undisciplined. Hence
                                  education at this time is life saving for students. It also instills
                                  hope for a brighter future. So continuing education through
                                  online method is a nice opportunity for learners. We urgently
                                  need to support teachers, parents, innovators, communication
                                  experts and all those who are positioned to give education
                                  through online system. Although there are a lot of disadvantages
                                  of online education, still we can easily conclude from above
                                  discussion that online teaching is one of the safe and preferable
                                  windows of opportunity during pandemic situation. It is

                                  important to continue education in some form, otherwise it may
                                  adversely affect the future prospect of the learners as well the
                                  education system. This leaves any attempt to predict the likely
                                  influences of the internet on future forms of education on
                                  uncertain ground of course. It is unwise to adopt an overtly
                                  cynical view that there is nothing new about the internet based
                                  education at all, i.e. that the educational effect of the internet
                                  are simply a case of old wine in new bottles. Yet it’s equally
                                  unwise to presume that technology will overhaul the education
                                  system. Rather real transformation is not contactless transfer of
                                  knowledge but to help grow a resilient, socially responsive and
                                  sensitive pool of human resource.

                                  vogue due to COVID-19 has created a new era teaching.
                                  Teaching in Mathematics was confined to the traditional Chalk
                                  and Talk method. Technological development facilitates,
                                  strengthens and speeds up the performance of teaching and
                                  learning in Mathematics. Mathematics develops the student’s
                                  intellectual knowledge that will allow him to function personally
                                  and socially. It promotes creativity, brain development, problem
                                  solving ability and a key factor for the improvement of self-
                                  esteem and entrepreneurship. The main objective of this study
                                  is to identify the effectiveness of the online teaching and
                                  learning of Mathematics in schools and colleges. Also, this
                                  study explores the challenges and the perspectives of both the
                                  instructors and students in online mathematics teaching and
                                  learning.

                                    Introduction

                                    There has been a great change in the education system due
                                  to COVID-19 in recent years all over the world. Many developed
                                  countries are adopting the e-learning method in education. But
                                  in developing countries, online education is a burdensome
                                  process [11]. Teaching and evaluation process has been changed
                                  completely in the scenario of education. The education regulatory
                                  bodies of all the countries are directing their Higher Education
                                  Bodies, Universities, Colleges and Schools to adopt the
                                  Electronic Learning (e-Learning) system. (Al-Fraihat et al 2020)
                                  [2]. Countries have started heavily investing in Information and
                                  Communication Technology to reform the education.

                                    In India, the ICT proposal is included in the educational
                                  planning of the government (Aithal & Aithal, 2019) [1]. It is
                                  the duty of the nation to adopt educational reforms that will
                                  improve the learning, understanding and knowledge of the
                                  students those pursuing their schooling and higher education. It
                                  is their responsibility to ensure that education is being
                                  continuously provided in spite of any emergency situations
                                  arising due to Covid-19 pandemic.
                                    E-learning theory describes the cognitive science principles
                                  of effective multimedia learning using electronic educational
                                  technology. It is the process of learning with the help of
                                  electronic devices such as computers, smart phones and other
                                  gadgets etc. The major components of e-Learning are computers
                                  and other smart gadgets together with the internet. E-Learning
                                  can be done from any place. Online-learning has become more
                                  popular because of the development of technology (Cidral et
                                  al., 2018) [6]. The introduction of e-Learning is the latest
                                  technological development that has transformed education
                                  (Trelease, 2016) [13].
                                    All the schools and colleges in India, have been now
                                  instructed to take up Online teaching. But there are many issues
                                  still prevailing in the delivery of education through Online.

                                  Students from urban areas where the internet connectivity is
                                  good are able to get education through e-learning. But the
                                  students from remote rural areas where the connectivity is poor
                                  are unable to get their basic education through online teaching.
                                  The students from economically backward families are being
                                  pushed to end up their education during this pandemic. The rise
                                  of child labor and drop outs from colleges has been increased
                                  tremendously.
                                    Despite of all these hindrances, the severity of the Covid-19
                                  pandemic has changed the era of teaching, learning and
                                  evaluation process in the arena of education. The instructors or
                                  the teachers must be the first learners of online technology
                                  [12]. For the successful e-learning outcomes, the instructors
                                  must be updated with the variety of ICT teaching aids and
                                  tools. Also the students must be trained to use the e-learning
                                  methodologies and technologies.
























                                    When the process of online education started during the
                                  month of May-June 2020, it was considered to be a temporary
                                  process both in schools and colleges. But as the COVID-19
                                  created a gloomy negative wave around the world, the process

                                                                                     105]]></page><page Index="107"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  of e-learning started its path in a very serious manner and grew
                                  in response to the emergent necessity. Today online education
                                  has become a viable way of teaching, learning and evaluation
                                  process.
                                    Despite of the internet connectivity issues, there are many
                                  other problems in the online education such as no direct eye
                                  contact with the teacher, low interaction in the class, unpleasant
                                  home environment, possibility of distractions while learning
                                  through the gadgets and health issues arising due to the
                                  continuous usage of gadgets. A  high level of interaction is
                                  needed between the teacher and learner to overcome these
                                  obstacles in online education.
                                    Teaching through online has created a veritable challenge
                                  among the instructors to deliver their content in an interesting
                                  and innovative way [3]. Among all subjects, teaching
                                  Mathematics through online is a little more challenging. In
                                  online mathematics courses, the display of the mathematical
                                  concepts, problems and process steps of the solutions and
                                  effective realization of the student-teacher interaction are two
                                  factors that affect learning outcomes (Karal et al., 2013) [8,9].
                                  In learning about ways of mathematical thinking, logical
                                  inference and discussion of alternative solutions via student-
                                  teacher interaction constitute the basic principles of mathematics
                                  education (Baki, 2006) [5]. In addition, writing is a must for
                                  doing mathematics (Artemeva& Fox, 2011) [4]. Radford (2008)
                                  [10] emphasized that mathematical thinking occurs through a
                                  sophisticated semiotic coordination of speech, body, gestures,
                                  symbols, and tools. It is difficult to achieve sufficient interaction
                                  in an online learning environment by displaying mathematical
                                  concepts and symbols, which play a significant role in
                                  mathematics education, solely through use of a keyboard. This
                                  seems to be a limitation in the process of learning mathematics
                                  by online learners. Prior research reveals that mathematics
                                  instructors can have difficulty when explaining mathematical
                                  concepts visually in blended and online distance Mathematics
                                  course (Glass & Sue, 2008; Karal et al., 2013) [7,9].

                                    In this chapter, we have discussed in detail the effectiveness
                                  of the online teaching in Mathematics, challenges faced by the
                                  instructors in teaching Mathematics online and challenges
                                  faced by students in learning Mathematics online.
                                    Effectiveness of the Online Teaching in Mathematics:























                                    Today teaching in Mathematics has become interesting
                                  through online mode. On considering the effectiveness of
                                  online teaching in Mathematics, it mainly depends on the
                                  efforts taken by both the instructors and students. The amount
                                  of effort taken by the instructor to deliver the topic is an
                                  important factor. When the videos of both teacher and students
                                  are visible, the effectiveness could be more enhanced just like
                                  classroom teaching. But this type of teaching is available only
                                  in private schools where the students are forced to keep their
                                  videos turned on. In schools, children learn Mathematics through
                                  online games available in various websites. Teachers create
                                  videos and display them in online classes. So teaching
                                  Mathematics for kids has been made more interesting rather
                                  than the traditional classroom teaching.
                                    Teaching of Mathematics in higher classes and colleges has
                                  been made effective by creating effective lesson plans and

                                                                                     107]]></page><page Index="109"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  lesson notes. Lesson notes may be in the form of PPT
                                  presentation, hand written notes, book pdfs etc. The more effort
                                  taken by the teachers, the more effectiveness is achieved. With
                                  the help of the lesson notes given by Mathematics teachers, the
                                  students could be able to recall the concepts explained by them.
                                  The need for copying lesson notes is highly reduced. They can
                                  utilize the lesson notes prepared by the teachers whenever
                                  necessary. Recording of the online sessions can be saved and
                                  used by the students to clarify their doubts. A  recorded class
                                  can be utilized even by the absentees. Peer-to-peer interactions
                                  are a vital part of learning, but peer socialization can also
                                  provide distractions in the form of bullying, flirtations, and
                                  rivalries. These can be minimized with online teaching.

                                    The effectiveness of online teaching is that how the students
                                  utilize the resources shared by the instructor or teacher. By
                                  allowing students to access lesson videos (or to record online
                                  sessions), students have more flexibility to skip the material
                                  they already understand or pause to focus on what they find to
                                  be particularly challenging. In Mathematics, continuity in lessons
                                  is required for better understanding. Hence the students who
                                  are with more concentration acquire more knowledge with
                                  online teaching. In online teaching a teacher can teach more
                                  number of students than his or her classroom. Teachers can
                                  save time by automatizing the marking of multiple choice tests
                                  without needing to spend time supervising in-class examinations.
                                    Through the Online courses offered by Swayam –NPTEL, a
                                  student at remote villages are able to watch classes taken by
                                  Professors at IIT/NIT. Some Global Level Online Courses
                                  offered by various foreign universities are also available online.
                                  Students and teachers are enriching their knowledge through
                                  these global courses. They interact with professors through
                                  scheduled live interactions. Students gain knowledge in different
                                  innovative subjects at global level. With the large numbers of
                                  students enrolled in Massive Online Open Courses (MOOC),
                                  instructors cannot provide individualized feedback to any one

                                  choice exams. [16]
                                    The above said lack of face-to-face interaction is less of an
                                  issue when it comes to online teaching on a smaller scale. To
                                  initiate this type of Online learning, most valuable educational
                                  technology companies like Baiju’s have been started and students
                                  get enrolled in large numbers to receive private attention in
                                  learning during this Pandemic situation. The success of the
                                  Khan Academy, Skillshare and Udemy has demonstrated, the
                                  subject of mathematics was one of the first to be taught to a
                                  large number of students via online learning. And now, online
                                  learning has given greater access to a whole set of interesting
                                  subjects to learn about online.[16]
                                    Challenges faced by Instructors in Teaching Mathematics
                                  Online:
                                    Though, a lot is being discussed about the problems faced
                                  by students due to online classes, experts feel problems of the
                                  teachers remain unnoticed. Academicians feel there is urgent
                                  need to address the issues faced by the teachers. There is need
                                  to create infrastructure for online classes at the government
                                  schools and colleges and train teachers to operate online
                                  classes effectively. Teachers are facing a lot of stress related
                                  psychological issues due to online classes.

                                    An article published in the Indian Express dated 17th
                                  August 2021 [14], clearly explains the real situation of a 50-
                                  year-old Ganeshan, a Mathematics teacher at a government
                                  college in Coimbatore. He never thought the job, he had been
                                  enjoying since years will someday turn into a nightmare for
                                  him. His struggles started with the onset of online classes.

                                    For Ganeshan, even operating a smart phone was a tough
                                  task. However, he quickly learned and started taking online
                                  classes through laptop.  But now he feels that all his efforts
                                  were worthless. “Online classes are doing no good to his
                                  students and he could see that clearly. Due to financial and
                                  network issues, many rural students are not able to attend the
                                  classes. The few students who attend are hardly attentive and
                                  find it difficult to understand even if they miss a few steps. He
                                  feels helpless and frustrated and with no personal interaction
                                  with his students. He feels that his role from a knowledge
                                  provider has now been reduced to a mere facilitator.

                                    Umesh, who works as a guest lecturer in a Government Arts
                                  college in Tiruvarur, has far more serious issues to deal with.
                                  Umesh out of his Rs 20,000 salary, which he last received in
                                  March, has to spend Rs 2,000 every month towards rent of his
                                  laptop and internet expenses. It was too difficult for him to
                                  conduct online classes through his smart phone, so he rented a
                                  laptop. Initially he thought it was a matter of few months but
                                  now it was continuing for more than a year and he found it
                                  quite difficult to manage with fixed salary which he was not
                                  receiving regularly. These two articles cannot fully reflect the
                                  plight and predicament of many teachers. There are many more
                                  who are suffering terribly at various corners of the world.
                                    Increased screen time has added to severe stress and
                                  psychological issues among teachers. Many elderly teachers are
                                  struggling to cope up with this new medium of teaching and are
                                  under tremendous pressure to prove themselves. This has
                                  affected their confidence level and overall personality also.

                                  entire day in taking online classes and preparing for it. Even
                                  some of the teachers have narrated that they are not satisfied
                                  with their job and planning to quit.
                                    Many of the teachers complain of sleeplessness, irritation
                                  and even depression due the introduction of online classes in
                                  the Academic Curriculum. Online teaching has created a feel of
                                  nausea, headache and severe nervous disorders in elderly
                                  teachers due to the prolonged radiations emitted from the
                                  gadgets. Usage of earphones over a long period creates many
                                  issues relating to ears. Usage of gadgets for a long time creates
                                  problems in vision. This includes usage of computers for
                                  preparing lesson notes and usage of mobile phones for taking
                                  photos and converting it to pdfs etc. In recent days, the entire
                                  life of teachers has been spent in front of gadgets.
                                    There are three main challenges of online teaching: how to
                                  explain and present mathematics without face to face interaction,
                                  how to keep a record of student’s homework and assignments
                                  in real-time and how to assess their knowledge in the end.
                                  Mathematics must be vivid in color and explanation. It has to
                                  be visual and clear.
                                    The instructors in Mathematics face the most challenges
                                  while delivering the lectures through online Teaching. Teaching
                                  Mathematics in colleges, where the videos of the students are
                                  kept turned off usually is a real challenge to teachers. Teachers
                                  cannot read the face reactions. Teacher can interact only
                                  through their voices. Mathematics teaching using a whiteboard
                                  would be a best option in online teaching. But it has its own
                                  drawbacks like if the length of the problem is too big,
                                  implementation of this technique will be a great challenge. The
                                  materials with Mathematical formulas have to be prepared with
                                  at most care to display in presentation. Mathematics teachers
                                  have to spend approximately 2 hours of creating perfect lecture
                                  notes for taking an online class of half an hour. A  book pdf
                                  available in the concern topic will not explain all the required
                                  steps. So Mathematics teachers strive hard to create a content

                                                                                     111]]></page><page Index="113"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  or lecture notes so that the hearing students at the back screen
                                  could get the clear and in-depth picture of the problem. When
                                  teaching is made through presentations, usage of black board or
                                  Jam board is needed to explain the concepts.  To create an
                                  effective teaching in Mathematics many techniques has to be
                                  used by the teachers.

                                    In an online setting, it is difficult to teach a group of
                                  students with widely differing aptitudes in Mathematics.
                                  Aggressively implementing digital learning without creating
                                  adequate infrastructure for it in government schools and colleges
                                  is not a wise idea. We need to equip our schools and train
                                  teachers to ensure proper online learning. Despite of these
                                  inconveniences happening due to the current COVID-19
                                  pandemic situation, the teachers have adopted themselves to
                                  this era of education to lighten the lives of students through
                                  learning.
                                     Challenges faced by students in Learning Mathematics
                                                     through Online:















                                    Switching from traditional classroom and face to face
                                  instructor training to computer-based training in a virtual
                                  classroom makes the learning experience entirely different for
                                  the students. Their resistance to change doesn’t allow them to
                                  adapt to the online learning environment. There is always an
                                  initial resistance and skepticism towards a new form of
                                  technology [17]. It is true that online education – whether at a

                                  secondary school, college, or postgraduate level – has its share
                                  of drawbacks when compared to traditional brick-and-mortar
                                  teaching. Students are active in classroom because they could
                                  see the instructor, interact with him and clear the doubts.
                                  Another advantage is that they could communicate with the
                                  neighbor and have interactions regarding the subject and even
                                  clarify their problems and doubts among themselves.
                                    In online environment they are separated alone in a room.
                                  They could not view the facial reactions of the teacher. They
                                  become passive as their names are rarely mentioned by the
                                  teacher. They also lose their companion who sits aside him.
                                  They miss their interactions with the neighbor and feel shy
                                  enough to raise questions to the teacher whenever they are
                                  wrong and confused. This teaching environment gradually
                                  shutters his mind towards online teaching.

                                    Economic condition of the student’s family is the main issue
                                  in pursuing education through Online. Inability of the parents
                                  to provide gadgets to their wards is one of the main reasons for
                                  the backlog of online education. Students prevailing from poor
                                  families are forced to move out for the jobs. Students who have
                                  started to work in this pandemic situation continue with their
                                  jobs instead taking up online classes. Hence the drop-out ratio
                                  has drastically increased in the schools and colleges. In families
                                  with more children, the parents are unavailable to provide
                                  gadgets to every child. These are reasons for irregularity of the
                                  students in the online classes.

                                    Many students are not provided with the high bandwidth or
                                  the strong internet connection that online courses require, and
                                  thus fail to catch up with their virtual classmates. In mathematics
                                  coherence of seeing and hearing is most needed to understand
                                  the concepts. Due to low connectivity of internet, the problems
                                  become more mysterious in online learning. If continuous
                                  disturbances persist in the connectivity, then continuity in
                                  learning mathematics gets affected.

                                    Many of the Indian students are first generation learners
                                  who hail from poor socio-economic background. As such they
                                  have access to neither private tuition nor guidance at home. In
                                  this online format of teaching, they are finding it difficult to
                                  understand and solve complex mathematical problems. Students
                                  are not guided and monitored when both the parents are
                                  working. In this situation, Students take up their online classes
                                  with low interest.
                                    Education through online classes has made the students
                                  getting addicted to use the gadgets. As they take up their online
                                  classes through mobile phones, even during the classes they
                                  develop the habit of chatting with friends in WhatsApp, seeing
                                  videos in Facebook, browsing unwanted websites and playing
                                  games. This distracts their attention towards studies and get
                                  addicted in playing games.

                                    Typical challenges faced by the school students with
                                  math-related learning: [15]
                                    l Mistakes such as number additions, substitutions,
                                       omissions, and reversals in writing, reading, and recalling
                                       numbers.

                                    l Inconsistent results in addition, subtraction, multiplication,
                                       and division.

                                    l Inability to visualize; appearing absentminded or lost in
                                       thought.
                                    l Difficulty in remembering math facts, concepts, rules,
                                       formulas, sequences, and procedures.
                                    l Inconsistent mastery of math facts.

                                    l Difficulty following sequential procedures and directions
                                       in math steps.
                                    l Slowness in understanding math concepts in word
                                       problems.

                                    Mathematics requires deductive reasoning, and so passive
                                  learners often struggle with this kind of active problem solving
                                  techniques. Students with memory and attention problems also
                                  may struggle since both skill and knowledge is necessary for
                                  mathematical aptitude. Other problems common to mathematics
                                  students include computational weaknesses, difficulty in
                                  conceptualizing mathematical principles and language challenges
                                  in word problems.

                                    Typical challenges faced by the college students with
                                  learning mathematics online:
                                    l Missing the face to face interaction with the teachers.

                                    l Lack of visualization of problem solving techniques by
                                       the teachers.
                                    l Difficulty in understanding the logic in problems.

                                    l Loss of continuity in lessons.
                                    l Missing completely the writing practice and hence the
                                       problem solving capacity.
                                    l Experiencing computational weaknesses in the course of
                                       their mathematical assignments and exams.

                                    l Memorizing instead of understanding mathematical
                                       principles.
                                    l Creating a hatred toward mathematics

                                    Another important issue in online teaching and learning is
                                  the post evaluation process. Both in School and colleges,
                                  evaluation of teaching and learning is done through posting
                                  questions in the web portal or Google classroom and uploading
                                  the answer sheets. This process is totally ineffective because
                                  school students get help from parents while college students get
                                  help from friends in completing their exams. This type of
                                  evaluation cannot effectively measure the students’ knowledge.
                                  This format of exams has made the students to become copycat
                                  instead of learning to know and do solve problems independently

                                                                                     115]]></page><page Index="117"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  and confidently. The open book system of examination has
                                  made them dependent on books and other internet sources. The
                                  capacity to learn and reproduce in exams has decreased
                                  drastically. In Mathematics, the original problem solving ability
                                  of the student is not being evaluated. This would make the
                                  students forget the fundamental formulas and logic in Mathematics
                                  which would be very difficult for them to reuse in future.
                                    Many challenges are prevailing in teaching Mathematics
                                  through online both in School and College Scenario. Hence the
                                  intake of students towards learning Mathematics has been
                                  drastically reduced in recent years after COVID. Fundamental
                                  and basics in Mathematics is gained from school education. In
                                  recent years, due to COVID Lockdown school students have
                                  lost their fundamental knowledge in Mathematics. Online
                                  Mathematics teaching has created hatred towards learning
                                  Mathematics with interest and joy. We hope situations would
                                  undergo change so that students could attend classes again to
                                  realize the dream of happy learning.
                                    Conclusion
                                    It is a right of every student to get education irrespective of
                                  their economic condition. Government of India should take
                                  steps that even students at remote villages get education by all
                                  means. Infrastructure at Government schools and colleges must
                                  be improved to spread the Online Education System. In many
                                  of the Government schools students are yet to receive high-end
                                  education. Technology must be developed in such a way that
                                  during online classes students should not be allowed to access
                                  with other unwanted apps. Effective software must be introduced
                                  for conducting online exams and for evaluation process. Unless
                                  the post evaluation process becomes serious, the effectiveness
                                  of online education system would be still ineffective.
                                    Being aware of the pandemic breakouts, Government of
                                  India and the Educationists must ensure the proper streamline

                                  must pass out with true knowledge. The development of a
                                  country lies in the hands of today’s students. Hence care must
                                  be taken to educate the students by all means. Along with
                                  online learning, practical knowledge is also very important for
                                  the successful completion of technical courses. So students
                                  must be educated together with the practical knowledge. Today
                                  the education system is based on technology, hence both the
                                  teachers and students must be adapted to this system of online
                                  teaching, learning and evaluation process as rapidly as possible.

                                  Abstract:
                                  From the Wuhan region of China, to the entire world, covid-19
                                  has claimed millions of life, jobs, freedom to move about freely
                                  and live freely. World over, people have reluctantly come to
                                  cohabit with this mass killer, modifying their lives accordingly.
                                  Though economy has been the worst hit, academicians, teachers
                                  and students have constantly fought and are still fighting for
                                  their fundamental right, i.e. the right to education. Various
                                  online platforms of teaching-learning have come to the aid of
                                  the students, teachers and researchers. The information age that
                                  dawned in the 1990s in India, brought with it technology
                                  transfer and technological know-how. During the pandemic, the
                                  benefit of this was definitely felt. But the solution, of the
                                  problem that covid-19 brought, is not so easy. For a developing
                                  country like India, the problem is doubled by the existence of
                                  economic and regional disparities and bureaucratic corruption.
                                  Also it needs to be highlighted that online-teaching learning

                                  methods and approaches are not the same for all levels of
                                  learning and that each level has its own problems.

                                    Introduction
                                    Human evolution did not follow a single continuum. That is
                                  to say, the physiological and behavioural characteristics of
                                  humans did not evolve in a single time frame. While the
                                  biological abilities evolved about 4 million years ago the
                                  neurological complexes and cranial complexities evolved much
                                  later. Neanderthals were known to fight their environment to
                                  survive. The modern man or the Homo sapiens evolved from
                                  the Neanderthals. Nature or the natural world involves the
                                  ecosystem that survives through a cycle of give and take. Every
                                  minute living organism in this ecosystem has its share of duties
                                  that sustain life on earth. Even the non-living factors of the
                                  ecosystem like gases, water and light and sound particles are
                                  essential to existence. The early man resembling the ape used
                                  to fight the harsh effects of nature like the rain, snow, volcanic
                                  eruption, attack by wild animals, and climate change. But they
                                  also depended on nature itself for their survival. It provided
                                  them with food. An increase in population coupled with
                                  division of labour brought about a change in this nature-man
                                  relationship.  As early as 1864, in the book Man and Nature,
                                  by George Perkins Marsh, the author discussed the ill-effects of
                                  deforestation, soil erosion and population expansion as major
                                  causes for the extinction of many races and issued a warning
                                  to the American society to take heed from the ancestors. The
                                  COVID-19 epidemic that engulfed China in December 2019
                                  was partly the result of the mutilation of the natural world by
                                  the human race, not for survival but consumerism. Various
                                  claims have been forwarded as to the origin of the coronavirus
                                  in humans. Bat-soup is a delicacy in the Eastern part of the
                                  Asian continent. The virus that causes COVID-19 i.e. SARS-

                                  CoV-2 has many identical traits and symptoms with a particular
                                  strain of coronavirus found in bats. Scientists and anthropologists
                                  also claim that this particular virus causing acute respiratory
                                  distress and multi-organ failure in human beings historically
                                  originated 55 million years ago in bats and other avian beings.
                                  Lab malfunction and the invention of sophisticated biochemical
                                  weapons have been other probable causes of the pandemic. It
                                  seems appropriate to quote Mahatma Gandhi here- “the earth
                                  provides enough for everyman’s need, but not everyman’s
                                  greed.”
                                    As the covid-19 epidemic turned into a pandemic, the
                                  economy was the worst sufferer. But what worried the academic
                                  community, the parents and young minds the most was the road
                                  ahead in the learning process. Worldwide lockdowns posed the
                                  worrying question- would the qualitative aspect of teaching-
                                  learning be the same in this endangered world as compared to
                                  the pre-Covid world? Through the trial and error method,
                                  various procedures were introduced by the academic community
                                  so that the learning process continues unabated. Full utilization
                                  was made and continues to being made of the technological
                                  advances in the field of education and new techniques are still
                                  coming up.
                                    The Approaches to Technology-Guided Education

                                    Technology-guided education steadily evolved with the
                                  beginning of the information era in 1989 when the World Wide
                                  Web was invented by Sir Tim Lee Burners. The industrial age
                                  was proceeded by the information age, where pure classroom
                                  teaching was augmented by computers and projectors. Even
                                  before the onset of the covid-19 pandemic, globalization
                                  introduced an inter-connected education system where
                                  accessibility is the keyword. It refers to accessibility in terms of
                                  students, teachers, learning materials, tools of learning, library,
                                  rare book archive and more importantly accessibility to
                                  knowledge in general. Of course, this access spells different
                                  meaning so far as the developing world and developed world

                                                                                     121]]></page><page Index="123"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  is concerned, but that gap has been sought to be bridged by the
                                  statesmen. Sometimes the bridging act has been forced and
                                  vote-bank oriented and sometimes it has been forced as a part
                                  of the natural process of development. The approaches to
                                  technology-guided education or as the pandemic affected world
                                  calls it ‘online education’ are specifically purpose-oriented and
                                  unique in their methods. Each approach has its limitations so
                                  far as developing societies are concerned.
                                    1. The age-old/conventional approach: the word ‘online’
                                       was a modified version of the word line which was
                                       conventionally referred to as the telephone wire or cord.
                                       ‘I am on line’, at that time meant ‘I am talking over the
                                       telephone. More sophisticated technologies followed the
                                       telephone, and Alexander Graham Bell was replaced by
                                       Charles Babbage, John F. Mitchell, Martin Cooper, Bob
                                       Cahn, Vincent Cerf and finally by multinational
                                       corporations like IBM and Apple. As the covid-19 made
                                       its impact on the teaching-learning process, the telephone
                                       and its modified version the cell phone came to the
                                       immediate rescue. As schools and colleges were shutting
                                       down world-wide conference call over the mobile phone
                                       was the most popular platform of communication. It was
                                       readily available to all irrespective of the fact that
                                       whether they belong to the urban population or the rural,
                                       the haves or the have-nots, fast-network-area or a slow-
                                       network area, and the sheer fact that whether smartphones
                                       are available or not. Data suggests that as covid made its
                                       presence felt, 1.2 billion students all over the world were
                                       out of the classroom. This statistic represents a mixed
                                       group in terms of economy and social position. Though
                                       readily available to all, ‘on line’ teaching as compared to
                                       ‘online’  teaching has its disadvantage. This method is
                                       convenient with smaller groups of 5 to 6, as most mobile
                                       phones do not allow more than 5 or 6 members to join
                                       the call. Also, a larger number affects effective teaching
                                       and learning as voices become muffled and feedback

                                  122]]></page><page Index="124"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                       hardly audible. Students in this mode prefer to remain
                                       mute audiences as they struggle with both hearing the
                                       teacher and taking down class notes. Again, while the
                                       students are taking down notes, for the ease of writing
                                       they prefer not to use headphones but keep their phones
                                       on speaker mode. This results in the echo of the teacher’s
                                       voice where he/she instructs the students to keep their
                                       phones mute. And thus teaching-learning here become a
                                       one-way process with no scope for feedback.
                                    2. The customized-exclusive approach:  this approach
                                       includes a host of internet-based online applications like;
                                       Google Meet, Google Classroom, Zoom Meetings,
                                       blackboard learn, Coursera, Classwize, Udemy, Seesaw,
                                       G Suite etc. This approach has been called the customized
                                       approach because the methods used here provide ample
                                       scope for interaction between the teacher and the students
                                       and they can be customized to suit the needs of the
                                       parties involved. All three of the above-mentioned
                                       applications enable the making of presentations, sharing
                                       of the screen, asking for feedback from the students,
                                       setting of reminders for the class to start, no boundaries
                                       as to the number of students that can be incorporated.
                                       Why this approach has been called the exclusive approach
                                       needs detailed diagnosis. The use of Information and
                                       Communication Technology in education started in the
                                       1990s. Before the onset of covid-19, globalization ensured
                                       the adoption of technology-guided education to the extent
                                       that the global investment in Information and
                                       Communication Technology in education reached 18.66
                                       billion US dollars in 2019.  Online education, it has been
                                       argued helps in augmenting retention capacity in students
                                       and as such more and more online techniques should be
                                       used. This approach has been called the exclusive
                                       approach for a variety of reasons. Firstly, it excludes the
                                       marginalized class by making the ownership and know-
                                       how of electronic gadgets and technology compulsory.

                                                                                     123]]></page><page Index="125"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                       Secondly, it excludes the remote areas where internet
                                       connection is not constant if at all available. Thirdly, it
                                       excludes those for whom school mean midday meals,
                                       occasional ration for family, escape from household
                                       chores and roadside gambling and smoking among the
                                       under-aged. Fourthly, by providing a multitude of
                                       platforms for teaching-learning, online classes hardly
                                       leave any scope for self-motivation among the students
                                       who get used to a monotonous flow of information. Thus
                                       technology-guided education excludes the healthy
                                       competition between the mediocre, the below-mediocre,
                                       and the above-mediocre.
                                    3. The upload-download approach: the latest Information
                                       and Communication Technologies that are being used
                                       the world over for education includes cloud computing,
                                       mobile learning, tablet computing, open content, 3D
                                       Printing, learning analytics, Massive Open Online
                                       Courses, etc. In India, as reported by the leading daily
                                       Times of India, in April 2021, 75% of online teaching
                                       takes resort to WhatsApp as the main platform for
                                       sharing knowledge, closely followed by phone calls
                                       which record a 38%. Learning materials available over
                                       the web are being rigorously used by the teachers and
                                       the students during this pandemic. Cloud computing
                                       particularly proved to be beneficial for secondary, higher
                                       secondary and college education as it does not require a
                                       residential server to avail of its services as compared to
                                       the internet. It has been a significant commercial success
                                       even before the spread of the coronavirus because it
                                       comes at a reasonable price. Access to rare books and
                                       journals, interactive media platforms, self-assessment
                                       programmes, formation of students groups for the
                                       exchange of ideas are all offered by cloud computing
                                       technologies. Open content and learning analytics are
                                       specifically beneficial for higher education and research.
                                       Open content provides access to materials that have

                                       copyright and is also called ‘open educational resources’
                                       because they are specially licensed so that students and
                                       researchers can avail them without any time limit. Also,
                                       they are available free of cost. Technology-guided
                                       education transformed into technology-centred education
                                       during the pandemic. Technology-centred education has
                                       in turn, as claimed by psychologists, given rise to the
                                       ‘5R activities’- retain, reuse, revise, remix and redistribute.
                                       Retain refers to the storing and downloading of content,
                                       reusing means sharing of the content freely, revision
                                       refers to modifications and alterations, remixing refers to
                                       combining the content with other information and
                                       resources and finally redistributing means the right to
                                       share the modified content. Learning analytics is another
                                       technology that has proved to be very useful during this
                                       period of crisis. Put in simple words it means e-analysis
                                       of individual students and gathering data about their
                                       performance and capabilities aiming at their improvement.
                                       Learning analytics also strive to improve the quality and
                                       methods of online teaching.

                                    While all the approaches discussed above have their pros
                                  and cons, it is elementary to discuss the individual approaches
                                  in the light of the educational level they are used for. Educational
                                  levels for practical purposes can be divided into the following
                                  categories:
                                    a. Elementary Level

                                    b. Secondary Level and Higher Secondary Level
                                    c. College Level and University Level
                                    Elementary Level: there are about 1.5 million educational
                                  institutions in India. Out of these 1.5 million institutions,
                                  840,000 belong to recognized primary schools. From this
                                  figure, we can easily guess the number of children that went
                                  out of classrooms during the pandemic. Elementary education,
                                  made mandatory by the Government of India, forms the basis

                                                                                     125]]></page><page Index="127"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  of one’s career. In India, elementary education shows a huge
                                  qualitative difference between the urban and rural areas. In the
                                  urban areas also, a qualitative difference exists between the
                                  private schools and the government organizations. Urban-
                                  private institutions are characterized by- punctuality, motivation
                                  in the form of digital classroom, school fests and fairs,
                                  playrooms, personalized school merchandise, expensively
                                  equipped gymnasium and playgrounds, trips and excursions,
                                  highly personalized modes of extra-curricular activities, air-
                                  conditioned classrooms, the use of digital equipment from an
                                  early age, and over and above all well-trained and efficient
                                  teachers. In comparison, urban-government organizations are
                                  characterized by punctuality with lapses, forced discipline with
                                  severe punishment, lack of motivation caused by an absence of
                                  efficient and properly trained teachers, digital knowledge
                                  provided by teachers who themselves show lack of confidence
                                  in the use of technology, inability to keep up with latest
                                  technologies owing to economic condition and poor
                                  infrastructure, ill-equipped playgrounds, inferior quality of
                                  teaching-learning equipment. The learning process must be able
                                  to engage the young minds. At the elementary level children are
                                  more prone to respond to visual aids in learning. The pandemic
                                  has severely undermined this element in primary education, so
                                  far as the urban-government and rural-urban institutions are
                                  concerned. In these institutions, the most used visual aid in
                                  learning was the blackboard, followed by digital classrooms in
                                  some but not all. In absence of visual aids, peers, midday
                                  meals, online teaching-learning over phone calls and very basic
                                  electronic gadgets, becomes a mere tedious chore for these
                                  children. It is expected that as schools reopen after the pandemic,
                                  the rate of school dropout in India would increase further.
                                  Another definite problem for the rural population is the language
                                  problem. Most of the online applications used for educational
                                  purposes provide instruction in English and rarely in vernacular.
                                  If the pandemic enforced technology-centred education is here
                                  to stay, India must devote more of its time evolving learning

                                  platforms in the vernacular language. The applications most
                                  used in primary education are Duolingo, ClassDojo, DragonBox,
                                  Quick Maths, etc. State-run primary institutions in India need
                                  formal training for the teachers in digital teaching, systematic
                                  up-gradation of curriculum, and area-wise planned investment
                                  if they are to gain from educational technologies.

                                    Secondary and Higher Secondary Level: these levels
                                  specifically deal with teenagers and coping with their needs
                                  and mental development is crucial. Indian education system
                                  faces the problem of bridging the gap between elementary and
                                  secondary education, which till now has been managed rather
                                  poorly. Here also the glaring qualitative difference between
                                  private and public institutions comes to the fore. The success
                                  rate of students depends on a well-maintained connection
                                  between the elementary and secondary and higher secondary
                                  levels. E-learning at this stage involves digitalization of the
                                  library, downloading and sharing of learning materials over the
                                  web, science projects prepared over the electronic platform,
                                  environmental orientation with digital projections, inculcation
                                  of a healthy lifestyle by digitally projecting the benefit of yoga
                                  and exercise and other sports. Funding in secondary and higher
                                  secondary education runs on the joint effort of the central and
                                  the state governments. Consequently, investment in secondary
                                  and higher secondary education is greater than elementary
                                  education. With covid-19 making its presence permanent, the
                                  problems faced by the students of private and public schools
                                  are of different categories. For the private-owned schools, the
                                  problems include- stay-at-home imbued monotony, absence of
                                  a healthy classroom competition among the peers, lack of
                                  proper evaluation in the face of online examination, and a
                                  persistent worry that the younger generation may lose complete
                                  touch with reading actual books. Government-run schools in
                                  the effort to keeping up with the latest curriculum and modern
                                  technologies have sporadically introduced digital classrooms,
                                  computer education, online learning platforms for teacher
                                  education and telecasting of superior quality educational

                                                                                     127]]></page><page Index="129"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  programmes. In this connection it is necessary to mention the

                                  programmes and Annual Refresher Programme in Teaching

                                  and bringing the teachers up-to-date. The problems of online
                                  teaching-learning for the rural and government schools include-
                                  poor relationship with the digital world or the lack of digital
                                  background, lack of motivation with insufficient access to
                                  proper digital training, language problem and poor teacher-
                                  student relation given the large numbers in a classroom. Online
                                  education in India in recent times has met with a serious
                                                                               th
                                  criticism or drawback. Recently, the publication of 10  and 12 th
                                  standard results on the basis of regular class performance and
                                  class tests is agued to have jeopardized the career of many
                                  students. The question that needs to be asked here is how the
                                  individual students were evaluated before the publication of
                                  results? The teaching-learning process is a highly subjective
                                  one where personals values and beliefs are bound to be
                                  involved. Evaluation of answer scripts, even by the best of the
                                  minds fails to be objective. The proper use of learning analytics
                                  and digital graphs in this regard may have been proved to be
                                  beneficial. 85% of the total number of schools in India belongs
                                  to rural public schools. 91% of the rural schools provide lunch.
                                  Online learning here can hardly promise increased pass outs.
                                    College Level and University Level: virtual classes are
                                  there to stay. Before the onset of the pandemic, teachers and
                                  researchers were not unanimous about the benefit of technology-
                                  guided education. They were of the opinion that excessive use
                                  of digital platforms would undermine the teacher-student
                                  relationship and would make teaching-learning automated and
                                  less participatory. It would also hamper the time students spend
                                  in the libraries. The union budget declared in 2020, expended
                                  an estimated cost of 993 billion rupees in the education sector
                                  and reportedly this cost was 45 billion more than what was
                                  spent in the previous financial year. The Indian education
                                  budget has shown a consistent rise since 2014 which suggests

                                  the building of new institutions and incorporation of technology-
                                  guided education. Higher education is a complex amalgamation
                                  of general degree colleges, medical colleges, engineering and
                                  business management institutions, polytechnic institutions,
                                  universities and research organizations. Each of these institutions
                                  has its definite curriculum, infrastructure, methods of teaching
                                  and eligibilities required of both the students and the teachers.
                                  There are about 51,000 higher education institutions in India.
                                  Before the arrival of covid-19, the UGC made the regulation
                                  that for the timely completion of syllabus and conducting of
                                  examinations, the universities are required to finish 75% of the
                                  syllabus in the conventional classroom mode and 25% of the
                                  syllabus in online mode. As the Choice Based Credit System
                                  (CBCS) was introduced by the Indian universities and affiliated
                                  colleges, the teaching-learning process became more hectic
                                  with the completion of the semester syllabus in less than 6
                                  months’ time, conducting of internal assessment tests, and
                                  calculation of attendance of each student, holding of practical
                                  examinations for specific subjects and arranging for final
                                  semester examinations. After the introduction of this system in
                                  2017, the main problem encountered was the lack of an
                                  adequate number of teachers in many colleges to perform these
                                  functions satisfactorily. In the post-covid-19 era with online
                                  teaching-learning being the only medium, the whole exercise
                                  seems fruitless. The teachers are faced with the problem of
                                  one-way source to receiver delivery of lectures with inadequate
                                  or no feedback, the rush to complete syllabus in a time frame
                                  that seems impossible, sharing of reading materials online that
                                  come in a language that rural students are not able to understand,
                                  translating reading materials from English to vernacular,
                                  preparing of question papers which again is a fruitless job as
                                  students demand questions for only those topics which they
                                  have been able to accrue, and evaluation of copies that require
                                  no evaluation as they have been copied from somewhere else,
                                  word to word. The students on the other hand face the problem
                                  of lack of motivation, unrealistic demand from the teachers like

                                                                                     129]]></page><page Index="131"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  Instagram and Twitter have facilitated the use of technological

                                  and rural India is 85% and 69% respectively. There is no doubt
                                  that with the increasing investment in education, computer
                                  education has also increased and more and more students now

                                  a book or better still books and journals are now available over
                                  the sites like Jstor,  Internet Public Library, Lexis Nexis,
                                  National Digital Library etc. These sites also provide scholarly
                                  articles for researchers and in some cases, make provision for
                                  interactive learning together with information. With the
                                  digitalisation of the library, students and researchers can make
                                  good use of their time by searching the online catalogue, the
                                  process is even more convenient for the library professionals as
                                  online facilities mark a welcome break from the monotonous
                                  work of systematizing and organizing data.
                                    Though the pandemic forced everyone to stay at home and
                                  brought to the fore the problems of online teaching-learning, in
                                  rural and semi-rural India, one of the major benefits of
                                  educational technology is collaboration. Here the word
                                  collaboration has five different connotations: collaboration
                                  between teachers of different countries resulting in the sharing
                                  of ideas, opinions and resources; collaboration between library
                                  professionals resulting similarly in the exchange of ideas;
                                  technological advances made and resources available;

                                  online method;  interaction between the students themselves
                                  and sharing of values, beliefs, ideas about their future path,
                                  sharing of common problems and their possible solutions and
                                  finally, governmental collaboration resulting in the introduction
                                  of newer technologies, funds and grants-in-aid, employment
                                  opportunities and dealing with those aspects of students’ lives
                                  which have hitherto been unheard of in the developing societies.
                                  Students in their everyday life face such problems which call
                                  for clinical analysis, and words such as neurological illiteracy,
                                  attention deficit disorder, autism, clinical depression etc. have
                                  become popular through collaborative research.
                                    A recent fad in the field of technology-guided education is
                                  the idea of flipped classrooms. It refers to the teaching-learning
                                  process outside the conventional classroom method and makes
                                  use of the computer and web facilities. Flipped classroom
                                  includes e-lectures available online, YouTube videos on the
                                  specific subject, interactive computer sessions in which the
                                  students can actively participate and the facility of online tests.
                                  Flipped classrooms also provide the opportunity for self-
                                  assessment and self-evaluation. E-learning is here to stay even
                                  if, and when, the pandemic is over. Every aspect of our social
                                  existence, though we want it or not, is technology controlled.
                                  On the one hand, it has bridged the gap between time and space
                                  and on the other, it has led to knowledge gathering, knowledge
                                  assimilation and knowledge dispersion.
                                    Economic liberalization in the 1990s brought with it the
                                  transfer of technology and technological know-how. There is
                                  no doubt that an unprecedented progress was made in the field
                                  of education and employment. But technology transfer to the
                                  3 rd  world also included problems like the small size of the
                                  market, inadequate funding for the development of research
                                  infrastructure, the problem of bureaucratic ‘red-tapeism’, the
                                  urban-rural gap, traditional and ascribed value system that
                                  viewed the use of technology with much scepticism and
                                  political interference and corruption. With covid-19 shutting up

                                  the world, working digitally was the only option and India
                                  embraced this digital space partly out of compulsion and partly
                                  with newer expectations. While the white-collar jobs went on
                                  unabated with work-from-home mantra and means, the blue-
                                  collar jobs were in a crucial dilemma. In a crucial dilemma
                                  were also those children for whom learning means a gathering
                                  of 20 to 25 in mostly a dilapidated building, in front of a
                                  taskmaster with chalk and blackboard, copies and illustrated
                                  books open in front of them, writing down what the taskmaster
                                  tells them to and most importantly with the expectation that a
                                  hard day’s work would be paid off by a wholesome midday
                                  meal. Digital learning means nothing to them. But they are
                                  children with the same abilities and curiosity and rights as the
                                  children of the metro cities. While accounting for the benefits
                                  that online teaching-learning has brought about during the
                                  pandemic, this group of children with hopes for a better future
                                  must be accounted for. If governmental policies and measures
                                  are able to do justice to even one of such groups, policy
                                  achievements would not go in vain. Meanwhile, it has also
                                  been reported in newspapers that this particular task has been
                                  taken up by Non-Governmental Organizations, which are
                                  encouraging children of families below the poverty level to
                                  continue learning by providing them with books, copies, pencils
                                  and organizing for classes in open spaces. The children are also
                                  being provided with refreshments and an increase has been
                                  noticed in their attendance and eagerness to learn. What the
                                  government does in funding such activities in future would be
                                  interesting to notice.

                                  shift in the learning process. The process of learning has been
                                  changing according to many factors including the socio-
                                  environment change, globalization, industrial revolution and
                                  Covid-19 pandemic. In the modern scenario in the educational
                                  institutes’ online teaching learning takes place with well
                                  formulated online learning process. To provide the online
                                  learning to the students there is a need to provide the online
                                  professional development to the teachers to enable them to face
                                  the challenges and empower them to fulfill the goal of education

                                    Education plays a significant role in helping the individual
                                  to learn new knowledge and skills that enables them to survive
                                  in the life successfully. The world is changing dramatically. The
                                  last two decades have witnessed a revolution caused by Internet
                                  and education technology. They combined in a way that this
                                  synthesis provided the various opportunities to gain and apply
                                  knowledge and new skills. The Government of India realized
                                  the need of the hour and launched the Digital India Programme
                                  in 2015 with the vision to transform the India into digitally
                                  empowered society in all fields including education.
                                    Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, there was high
                                  adoption of the growth of the integration of technology in the
                                  teaching learning process. The COVID-19 outbreak, is not only
                                  causing health crises but also affecty all the aspects of life
                                  including education across the world. The educational institutes,
                                  however move on with the online learning and it has become
                                  more integral to the teachers’  daily professional life. The
                                  pandemic has forced the educational institutes to use the
                                  Online learning mode and technology has shaped the whole
                                  process of teaching learning from the traditional rote learning
                                  to the visual experiential learning. The modern 21 st  century
                                  society has made significant progress in digitalization and this
                                  unprecedented growth in use of information and communication
                                  technology has ushered in a boom in the online learning in the

                                    In the broad sense the term online refers to the learning
                                  which is led by using internet and web based educational
                                  delivery. During online learning the teacher and students are
                                  present geographically and physically at different places and


                                                                                     135]]></page><page Index="137"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  using the same software for teaching learning process. Online
                                  learning provides the system for the learner with provision for
                                  holding the flexible module based facilities. The first e-learning
                                  system started in 1960 by Donald Bitzer called “PLATO”. The
                                  e- learning device was designed to provide the computer based
                                  education. Over the period of time due to innovative network
                                  capabilities, the e-learning has become the foundation of the
                                  online learning. Online learning is upgraded method that has a
                                  lot of advantages and challenges too. In sync with the state of
                                  the art digital life style and technology convergences, the new
                                  learning mode now available through various ways include
                                  open learning, visual education apps, distance learning, web
                                  based learning , live classes, recorded lectures, online
                                  discussions. All these enable the learners to apply the received
                                  knowledge rather than memorize the knowledge. A  National
                                  online learning Day was established in July 2016.
                                    Paradigm shift in Education

                                    We derive the idea of “Paradigm shift” from the well-known
                                  book (1962) by Thomas Kuhn. Kuhn viewed that paradigm
                                  shift was not a logically determinate procedure. He took the
                                  examples of Darwin’s theory of evolution and Copernican
                                  revolution. Clayton Christensen focused on scientific research
                                  and referred to similar trend as “incremental”. In the field of
                                  education and learning, the foremost paradigm shift occurred
                                  when traditional learning system changed drastically and online
                                  learning came into being as the new trend in the 21 st  century.
                                  It provides flexible instructional delivery system with the help
                                  of Internet. One of the happening transformations in education
                                  sector is the evolving mode of teaching. Days are gone when
                                  the students were sitting passive in class and teachers were
                                  active in classroom learning. Traditional method is when teacher
                                  directs to learner through memorization and recitation techniques
                                  thereby not developing their critical thinking, problem solving
                                  and decision-making skills (sunalet.al.1994). Teachers played a
                                  major role and hold the supreme power to deliver knowledge

                                  and skills of the students. This was the most effective way of
                                  teaching. According to NEP2020 there is a shift from the
                                  traditional classroom teaching to the virtual experiential learning
                                  in which teachers are the facilitators and students are active
                                  learners. Now it would be too much to say that there was a
                                  sudden shift in the teaching learning process due to the
                                  COVID-19 pandemic. Teaching learning process underwent a
                                  drastic change. Traditional lectures and physical classrooms
                                  were transformed into online lectures and virtual classrooms.
                                  The push to the online teaching is relatively a new approach to
                                  teaching learning process that is building a new education
                                  system and online learning to fit the 21 st  century knowledge
                                  society.

                                    Various methods to incorporate online learning
                                    The approach of teaching-learning has undergone a
                                  remarkable transformation. Traditional methods of teaching-
                                  learning are shifting progressively towards online mode. The
                                  physical classrooms shifted to the digital online classroom to
                                  deliver and receive the lessons. The technology played a
                                  significant role in online learning. There are various teaching
                                  methods that can be applied to make the online learning
                                  efficient. The teaching methods selected by the teachers are
                                  based on the need and objective of the content to be delivered.

                                    The emergence of new technology i.e. ICT  has influenced
                                  every aspect of human life. Today a classroom without
                                  technology is inconceivable. Standard learning in the 21 st
                                  century is higher in order to train the students to survive and to
                                                                    st
                                  be successful in the highly competitive 21  century environment.
                                  Teachers need to acquire tech savvy skills and techno-
                                  pedagogical skills, additional knowledge in general and specific,
                                  and to refurbish their teaching with the application of recent
                                  technological principles and gadgets.

                                     Education due to rapid change is in the transition phase.

                                  by the students to provide online learning depending on the
                                  need of the content to be delivered:
                                    Presentations: These techniques make more significant
                                  impact on the learners. It allows to incorporate the images,
                                  videos, content and makes easy to deliver the content and adds
                                  interests that renders the content more intelligible and
                                  comprehensible.

                                    Online white boards: it is popular choice of the teachers as
                                  it allows the canvas to draw and write to explain, discuss, and
                                  practise and also evokes feedback.

                                    Pre-recorded lectures: The educators can record their
                                  lectures at their own pace and share with the learner. It
                                  enhances the retention and learning as learner view the recorded

                                  of the most popular methods in the education. The strategy is
                                  to shift the traditional classroom format. The students in the
                                  flipped classroom view the content or study material before the

                                  modeling the future of students (Bashir, 2019). National
                                  Education Policy (NEP) 2020 also emphasized that “Teacher as
                                  a torchbearer of the change”. Teachers are responsible to shape
                                  the future of the students. In the current scenario the purpose
                                  of the educational institutes is undergoing a paradigm shift to
                                  provide the learning opportunities to the students even in
                                  adverse conditions. An online learning system is preferred by
                                  the educational institutes around the world including India to
                                  reach the students to continue the learning process. Due to the
                                  COVID-19 pandemic the traditional learning is not possible.
                                  Online learning system played an important role during this
                                  crisis situation. With the help of ICT the teachers could reach
                                  out to the students to provide knowledge and skill. Students
                                  used their home computer and mobile via internet to continue
                                  learning. The online professional development is the new
                                  paradigm shift for the 21  century teachers to be successful in
                                                       st
                                  professional life. There is a need to strive for new normal
                                  learning i.e. online learning to empower the teachers and students.
                                    CHALLENGES IN ONLINE LEARNING
                                    The drastic shift from the traditional teaching to the online
                                  teaching learning is a challenge to the teachers in many parts
                                  of the globe including India. As the change was sudden and the
                                  teachers were pushed to the situation and plugged into the new
                                  ways which they were not prepared and the foundation for the
                                  online learning was not ready. As regards online teaching
                                  learning the main challenges faced by the teachers were:
                                    Ø Lack of appropriate knowledge
                                    Ø Lack of resources

                                    Ø Lack of material
                                                                                     141]]></page><page Index="143"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                    Ø Lack of technology usage

                                    Ø Internet facility
                                    Ø Attitude towards technology
                                    Ø Chances of distractions

                                    Ø Very expensive
                                    Ø Internet access
                                    Ø Poor network
                                    Ø Computer illiterate

                                    These can create the situation of the struggle to participate
                                  in the online learning. Besides, some other bottlenecks are:
                                    Challenges to implement online learning in school

                                    (1) Teachers need to be equipped with good technological
                                  knowledge and simultaneously confidence is necessary to apply
                                  this approach successfully. With a high level of technological
                                  competency, teachers can readily learn new technology tools
                                  and use them in their courses (Cook, Owston, & Garrison,
                                  2004). There is no going back to the previous method of
                                  teaching.  Ertmer and Ottenbreit-Leftwich (2010) pointed out
                                  that knowledge of technology is essential to facilitate students’
                                  learning although it is not sufficient if the teacher does not feel
                                  confident using that knowledge
                                    (2) There are no defined standards to guide decisions as to
                                  how much or what part of courses can be replaced. Such
                                  decisions are influenced by many factors, mainly the nature of
                                  the course content and the intentions of the instructor (Vaughan,
                                  2007).
                                    (3) Prior experience in teaching and technology friendly
                                  approach is very useful.

                                    A key challenge when designing online learning course
                                  using this approach is to identify the parts of the course that do
                                  not work properly in the traditional format and then decide if
                                  142]]></page><page Index="144"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  it can work better online. Having little or no prior experience
                                  in teaching the course makes this process difficult.
                                     (4) Intensive long-term planning, observation and evaluation
                                  of the course are necessary for a successful implementation.
                                    Advantages of online learning
                                    The various researches showed that the online learning
                                  provides many advantages to the students and teachers. The
                                  few are given below:
                                    Flexibility: In the traditional classroom learning students
                                  received the knowledge from the teachers in a fixed time and
                                  at fixed place. In online learning education system provides
                                  flexibility to teachers and students to attend the classes at any
                                  place and learner can access the recorded lectures and videos
                                  later on whenever needed. It provides self-paced learning.
                                    Enhance Self -Motivation: In online learning learners are
                                  responsible for their own learning, this enhances the self-
                                  motivation for learning.

                                    Add joy to learning: Online learning facilitates various
                                  ways through videos, audios and other resources to learn in an
                                  easy way that adds joy to learning.

                                    Build confidence:  Learners are responsible for learning
                                  with motivation. They are to attend online classes on their own,
                                  submit their assignments and work on their own. This builds
                                  their self-confidence.

                                    Move from passive learning to active learning: Focus of
                                  classroom shifts on active learning and involves learners in
                                  situations which force them to read, speak, listen and think.
                                    Enhance Collaboration: Provide learners the opportunities
                                  learn together and apart interactive content enables them to
                                  create high interest and accountability.
                                    Disadvantages of online learning:

                                    l Distraction and poor internet facilities
                                    l In most cases pros outweigh the cons
                                    l The best way to guard against any negative effect of
                                       technology intergradations and implementation is to
                                       ensure that teachers and students are trained and skilled.
                                    l When we use technology correct way, it helps the
                                       students to soar to success.

                                    Online professional development as a part of the
                                  paradigm shift in online learning

                                    Professional development is important and integral part of
                                  the professional life of the teachers. The term professional
                                  development usually means a formal process such as a
                                  conference, seminar or workshop for collaborative learning
                                  among members of a work team (Mizell, 2014).
                                    Wright (2017) examined the impact of online professional
                                  development to enhance the capacity of teachers and teaching

                                  must become students of their own learning (Dash, 2016).
                                  Active online presence and collaboration with each other on
                                  the selected platforms also helped them feel more confident in
                                  preparing their own students (Naghavati, 2016).

                                    In this new era of globalization, industrialization, economic
                                  revolution, and new issues lies in the from of pandemics, there
                                  is a paradigm shift from the traditional professional development
                                  to the online professional development training programmes.
                                  The main reason to shift to online learning is that teachers and
                                  students are not dependent on their institutes for their learning.
                                  Various online professional development training programmes
                                  are available and this offers a bouquet of the opportunities to
                                  the teachers and students to learn according to their need to
                                  make them more effective in their professional life and help
                                  them to be the asset for their institutes. There are various types
                                  of online professional development courses now available to

                                  in, and need for online courses and programs (Hartshorne et al;
                                  2020) (Lay, Allman, Cutri and Kimmons, 2020). The teachers
                                  find new ways to teach students and fulfill the goal of education
                                  according to the need of the society and time by using
                                  technology and significantly showed progress with the online
                                  professional development training programmes. The online
                                  professional development training programmes enhance the
                                  efficacy and effectiveness of the teachers and help them to

                                  students. The motivation and empowerment of the teachers is
                                  required to ensure the best possible future for our children and
                                  our nation.
                                    According to the New Education Policy 2020 there is a shift
                                  from the traditional rote learning and emphasis is on the
                                  experiential virtual online learning. This can be possible only
                                  when our teachers are trained. Days are passed when teachers
                                  were not allowed to use the mobile phones in the school. The
                                  shift in learning made the mobile and laptop an effective tool
                                  to aid the teaching-learning process. Nowadays learning is not
                                  possible without the usage of the technology and these tools.
                                  Teachers’  professional learning is of increasing interest as a
                                  critical way to support the increasingly demanding system.
                                  Simultaneously students need to learn computer skills in order
                                  to succeed in the 21 st  century (Darling-Hammond, Hyler and

                                  the online learning to cope up with the paradigm shift and
                                  survive successfully in the professional life to meet the
                                  requirements of society and educational goals.

                                    Education in the 21  century is affected by various factors
                                  including globalization, economic revolution, new education

                                  learning. The traditional way of learning shifted drastically to
                                  the online learning. The online learning is the need of the time
                                  for the educational institutes to reach out to the students to
                                  continue the learning. In that case the teachers who play an

                                  younger generation due to Covid-19 pandemic situation. The
                                  article found that there are various issues regarding online
                                  education and these issues have to be solved in order to sustain
                                  the quality of education for future generation. Technical issues
                                  are more important than any other faced by teachers. This
                                  paper also discusses online learning tools too.

                                  educator compensates for the lack of physical presence in the
                                  virtual classroom by creating a supportive environment where
                                  all students feel comfortable in online classes (Joshua). It plays
                                  a significant role in transforming our lives to the digital world
                                  by providing flexible places, class timings and quality content.
                                  It provides a way to the development of human resource at the
                                  time of physical isolation due to pandemics.
                                    The corona virus pandemic has led to an unprecedented
                                  crisis in the present time and it has also disrupted the education
                                  sector globally. Classes have been suspended to enforce social
                                  distancing and educational institutions, from schools to
                                  universities, have shifted to online methods of teaching and
                                  evaluation. As the number of cases continues to rise, there is no
                                  certainty about when normalcy will be restored. This has
                                  encouraged some sort of a permanent tilt, if not a complete
                                  shift, towards online education.
                                    As per UNESCO, most governments around the world have
                                  temporarily closed educational institutions to control the spread
                                  of the Covid-19 pandemic. With an increasing number of
                                  states, provinces and even whole countries closing institutions
                                  of learning and over 91% of the world’s student population are
                                  not attending schools/colleges.

                                    However, in this pandemic situation of Covid-19, learning
                                  can now be realized online and knowledge can be transferred
                                  virtually using multiple media. Online learning is the best
                                  solution during this crisis. Online learning is beneficial because
                                  it is instantly accessible and offers flexible scheduling. In this
                                  system, learners use Internet technology to communicate virtually
                                  with their teachers and fellow learners through Email, WhatsApp,
                                  Video conferencing, instant messaging or using other tools. The
                                  value of online learning is being recognized by more
                                  organizations, since it is a cost-effective way to deliver to a
                                  large number of people. It can produce significant results by
                                  not only decreasing costs but also by improving performance.

                                    4) To find out the challenges of online learning.
                                    1) Quality of online learning and teaching:
                                    Quality learning is the goal for any online education program.
                                  Quality of online learning takes full advantage of a variety of

                                  by learners with special needs.  Teachers are to participate in
                                  online programs or courses of study; they first need access to
                                  the most basic infrastructure like electricity, hardware, software,
                                  good connectivity, and resources such as books and learning
                                  materials.

                                    2) Different tools to learn through online education:
                                    Ø Google Meet: Google Meet (formerly known as Hangouts
                                       Meet) is a video-communication service developed by
                                       Google. It is one of two apps  that constitute the

                                       online learning. It is necessary to have a qualified
                                       teacher to create the course schedules and curriculum
                                       according to the student’s requirements. A flexible lesson

                                       such as emails, online documents, and discussion forums
                                       can assist with this. An instructional video on how to
                                       upload assignments or how to send in questions relating
                                       to the course in an open forum will give students clarity.
                                       All of these approaches will also go a long way in
                                       ensuring that the class understands one’s teaching
                                       presence. The effectiveness of an alternative learning
                                       system depends on three factors:
                                    Engaging Learning Environment
                                    Keeping the students involved during the lecture and
                                  encouraging participation through regular polls or activities
                                  engages their interest.

                                    Well-designed online courses can use multimedia tools to
                                  help impart information that stays with the students even after
                                  the lecture ends.
                                    User-Friendly environment

                                    To make the environment user friendly, it is important to
                                  start the class with a greeting and let students see your face and
                                  pose a question like “How are you feeling today?” before
                                  jumping into content straightway for the day. Another most
                                  important thing is to set an agenda, include a learning target so
                                  that students know what to expect from the lesson.

                                       the teacher. Embracing digital communication through
                                       emails, student chat rooms, social media channels, online
                                       forums, and more, is the key to increasing the

                                    Each student has different requirements, and not all students
                                  respond to the same teaching method as others. One student
                                  may absorb information better in text form, but another may
                                  prefer visual multimedia presentations. To facilitate the learning

                                  feedback from every student is vital.
                                    Reflecting on improvements that can be made to the
                                  curriculum or the mode of delivery of the lecture will allow you
                                  to make changes to improve the eLearning experience. Various

                                  needs is vital.
                                    Additionally, evaluation of assessments and assignments
                                  can help determine the effectiveness of the online learning
                                  approach you have taken. If students are performing well, you
                                  can rest assured that there is plenty of communication and the
                                  coursework is being conveyed to them efficiently.

                                    However, if their work shows signs of confusion, there may
                                  be an issue in the lecture’s content. In either case, feedback can
                                  give you a clear picture of how successful your online education
                                  approach is.

                                    Result-oriented assessments can be designed to analyze the
                                  student’s areas of strengths and weakness. The results can be
                                  used to recommend resources or study materials for the area of
                                  improvement. This is a progressive and effective alternative to
                                  a student failing the course and having to retake it. With the
                                  disadvantage that distance learning brings, it is even more
                                  important to make sure that students receive a fair chance in
                                  receiving their education.
                                    Asking for feedback directly lets students know that their
                                  opinions matter and that they are part of a team that works to
                                  improve and uplift one another. Essential questions to ask
                                  students in the feedback can be based on assigning a numerical
                                  value to each answer.
                                    4) Challenges in Online education:
                                    There are a lot of challenges faced by the students while
                                  taking online classes. Some of these challenges which need to
                                  be overcome are:
                                    Ø Ø Ø Ø Ø Student engagement:  Ensuring active student
                                       participation is the main challenge faced in online
                                       classroom. This could be attributed to the feeling of
                                       isolation among students, lack of peer interaction and
                                       opportunity for collaborative learning that happens in
                                       conventional classroom on campus.

                                                                                     155]]></page><page Index="157"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                    Even the students have to adapt to online learning using
                                  computers, tablets and mobile phones. What started as a short-
                                  term requirement now looks like will continue for longer
                                  duration.

                                    Ø Ø Ø Ø Ø Lack of infrastructure: Most institutes lacked the
                                       necessary infrastructure that could facilitate online
                                       learning. The teachers did not have the necessary gadgets
                                       and equipment that would help them in taking online
                                       lectures.
                                    Ø Ø Ø Ø Ø Adoption of technology: The shift to online teaching in
                                       India was very sudden this year. Most educational
                                       institutes and teachers were not prepared for this change.
                                       Teachers who were not very familiar with using
                                       technology had to grapple with tools of video
                                       conferencing, prepare presentations and learn a lot along
                                       with their regular job of teaching.
                                    Ø Ø Ø Ø Ø Computer Literacy: Although students are generally tech
                                       savvy and thus able to manage computers well, lack of
                                       computer literacy is a major issue among students today
                                       specially in technically underdeveloped/developing
                                       countries. Many of them cannot even operate basic
                                       programs such as Microsoft Word and PowerPoint and
                                       therefore they are not able to handle their files.

                                    Furthermore, many students find fixing basic computer
                                  problems troublesome, as they have no knowledge in this area.
                                  However, technological proficiency is a must for following
                                  online courses, as it enables students to manage their assignments
                                  and courseware in an organized manner without struggling.
                                    Overcome these challenges:
                                    Though there are lots of challenges being faced by the
                                  teachers as well as students while participating in the online
                                  classes, these challenges can be tackled by using the following
                                  methods:

                                    v Unlike conventional classroom, online classroom requires
                                       teachers to adopt certain instructional strategies such as
                                       pre and post class activities using Learning Management
                                       System (LMS) to ensure active student engagement.
                                       Teachers need to use online pedagogies such as Team
                                       Based Learning (TBL), discussion forums and use of
                                       Open Education Resources (OERs) including SWAYAM
                                       and NPTEL courses to make classes more engaging.
                                    v For online classes, teachers are required to put in
                                       significant amount of effort in preparation of engaging
                                       presentations and in-class activities. There is need to
                                       train teachers on effective online teaching using online
                                       tools.
                                    Here the author of this paper perceived an increasing need
                                  for training teachers in the use of technology and online
                                  delivery of academic content in an innovative and student
                                  centric manner. Innovations also will be required in designing
                                  structured evaluation tools with more emphasis on continuous
                                  evaluation. More stress perhaps will be required in formative
                                  evaluation and less on summative evaluation.
                                    v Teachers in disciplines with skill-oriented courses face
                                       far more challenges in online teaching than their
                                       counterparts in other courses. Most of these courses
                                       require them to use software and simulations to explain
                                       the concepts.

                                    Without doubt, there will be shortcomings in imparting
                                  skill-based learning in a completely online platform. This will
                                  be felt more in HEIs offering programs in Health Care.
                                    v Substantial investment will be required by HEIs for
                                       technology upgrade and online delivery platforms. There
                                       will be requirement of redesigning classrooms and lecture
                                       theatres to make them compatible with online delivery
                                       and to make these sessions interactive. There will be
                                       requirement to equip them with recording devices for
                                       providing access of these sessions to students later.

                                                                                     157]]></page><page Index="159"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                    v Availability of uninterrupted internet to access online
                                       classes has been a challenge for most students. Although
                                       the internet penetration rate in India is more than
                                       50%, still some rural areas are deprived of internet
                                       connectivity. Intermittent connectivity often poses
                                       difficulties in getting seamless online learning experience.
                                       There is an urgent to need to ensure internet access to
                                       rural areas of the country.
                                    Future online classroom will take more structured approach
                                  in terms of content delivery and pedagogies. Teachers need to
                                  invest their time on creation of engaging online content for
                                  both asynchronous and synchronous learning.

                                    Going forward one can visualize programmes being
                                  developed and delivered in a blended mode with a combination
                                  of online learning and campus-based institutional learning.

                                  central Governments will be required to help HEIs in this
                                  vision. Any kind of disruption especially in technology requires
                                  substantial investments for infrastructure and training.

                                  classrooms to avoid the spread of the pandemic. The complete
                                  shutdown of the education institutions caused a major
                                  interruption in the academic year and brought a big gap in the
                                  learning for students. However, most of the schools managed to
                                  organize online classes for students offering safe learning at
                                  their homes. But, now the biggest question comes out to be is
                                  that if online learning is really beneficial for students or it has
                                  any adverse effects on them.
                                    Let us check out some major advantages and disadvantages
                                  of the online classes for students:

                                    Advantages:
                                    Ø Ø Ø Ø Ø  Keeps students regular  and disciplined
                                    A virtual classroom requires students to be present on time
                                  and join the class with an attentive mind. It has helped in
                                  reworking a routine for them so that they have a particular
                                  target for each day and they do not waste time doing unimportant
                                  activities. They get homework and assignments that help in
                                  keeping the students committed and disciplined towards their
                                  studies. In this way, the online classes ensure that the students
                                  continue to learn despite the schools shutting down.

                                    Ø Ø Ø Ø Ø  Easily accessible from any place
                                    Another major advantage of online learning is that it allows
                                  students to attend classes from any location of their choice.
                                  They only need a good internet connection a computer, laptop
                                  or a smartphone to attend the class. Students are now free from
                                  the daily hassles of commuting to school. Now, they just need
                                  to open their devices and sign in at the scheduled time to join
                                  the class. This has also improved the attendance of students.

                                    Ø Ø Ø Ø Ø  Cost of education is reduced
                                    This can be seen as a very important advantage in this
                                  period when the pandemic has already hit the budget of many
                                  families. Online classes have lowered down the huge amount of

                                  money for both the schools and students. Due to the schools
                                  being closed, the cost of their infrastructure and maintenance
                                  has decreased. This, in turn, has caused a drop in the school
                                  fees of students making education more economic for them.
                                  Online learning has also eliminated the cost of transportation.
                                    Ø Ø Ø Ø Ø  Students can keep away from distractions
                                    There are many students who are solo learners and get
                                  distracted by large groups in the classroom. There may be some
                                  notorious students in the classroom who might cause obstruction
                                  to focus on what the teacher has been teaching in the class
                                  whereas in case of online classes there is no such problem.
                                  Each and every student has a direct interaction with the teacher
                                  that helps in quick learning.

                                    Ø Ø Ø Ø Ø  Saves students from exposure to infections
                                    In virtual classes, students do not have to go to school and
                                  come in contact with others. This saves them from receiving
                                  any type of infections from others that helps in keeping their
                                  immune system strong. Moreover, being at home gives them a

                                    Digital learning has made learning interesting and fun for
                                  students. Earlier, students had two options – either they would
                                  travel daily to and from the coaching classes or they would
                                  compromise with a local tutor who may not be that great in
                                  teaching. But not anymore! Now, student can learn from the
                                  best online classes under the guidance of the highest-rated
                                  teachers.

                                    Online classes have eliminated the necessity of travelling
                                  daily to attend coaching classes, that too after school. Students
                                  aren’t required to face the rush hour traffic. Instead, they can

                                    Ø Ø Ø Ø Ø  Saves your  Time

                                    A lot of time used to be spent on conveyance. One of the
                                  key advantages of virtual classrooms is that one can save one’s
                                  energy and time. Anyone can take some time to refresh oneself.
                                    Disadvantages:
                                    Ø Ø Ø Ø Ø  Screen exposure may cause health issues among
                                  students
                                    During online classes, students have to sit before the
                                  screens of their devices for long periods of time. The classes
                                  may take 4-5 hours that can be quite tiring for students. Some
                                  students may suffer from eyesight issues. Long exposure to
                                  screens may also induce headache in many students. Sometimes
                                  students can also develop bad posture and other physical
                                  problems due to leaning towards their screens.
                                    Ø Ø Ø Ø Ø  Students struggle to focus on the screen
                                    For taking online classes, one’s device must be connected to
                                  the internet. This makes various social media and other sites
                                  easily accessible that comes to be the biggest distraction for
                                  students. Thus, while listening to the online lectures for long
                                  hours, the biggest challenge for students is to stay focused.
                                  Such situations can be avoided by being an active learner and
                                  keeping up the meaningful and relevant conversation with the
                                  teacher.

                                    Ø Ø Ø Ø Ø Network breakdown and other technology issues: This
                                  perhaps is the most common and the biggest disadvantage of
                                  online learning. Though the countries have worked far better
                                  for developing a good internet system, a consistent connection
                                  with decent speed is still a problem in many smaller cities and
                                  villages. Breakdown of internet connection or poor range of
                                  internet can break the continuity in learning for the child. This

                                  may discourage students from attending classes regularly and
                                  learning their curriculum.
                                    Ø Ø Ø Ø Ø  Lack of social interaction

                                    When in school, students get to learn a lot from their peers.
                                  While being with friends, they learn to be patient, get rid of
                                  disappointment and compete as well. There are many students
                                  who are habitual of enhancing their learning by participating in
                                  group studies and lively group discussions. However, in an
                                  online class, there is minimum or no physical interactions
                                  between students and teachers. This may result in a sense of
                                  isolation for the students that can affect their studies quite
                                  badly.

                                    Ø Ø Ø Ø Ø  Increased the responsibility of parents
                                    Online education has increased the responsibility of parents
                                  of students as they are required to observe their kids more
                                  closely what was earlier done by the teachers in the class. They
                                  have to keep an eye on their kids to check if they are attentive
                                  in the virtual class and are not wasting time in other activities.
                                    Due to this extra role of the invigilator, many parents feel
                                  tiresome in handling their work and their kids’ classes.
                                    Ø Ø Ø Ø Ø  Lack of access to the internet:
                                    Lack of access to the internet and devices has also created
                                  a gap in digital literacy. As many as 76% of students in India
                                  in the 5-35 age group did not know how to use a computer. The
                                  share of those who did not know how to use the internet was
                                  74.5%. Once again, this gap rises with a fall in income levels.
                                    Suggestions:
                                    We can improve the online learning and teaching methods
                                  through different ways. First of all we can build a personal
                                  connection with the students, motivate them to do their lessons
                                  properly. Increase students’ engagement for attending the online
                                  classes.  In online learning system  students have enough time

                                  to learn their lessons  but in rural areas students faces some
                                  issues like poor internet connection, Government need to take
                                  some effective measures so that the students belongs to remote
                                  areas also can access online classes as the students of urban
                                  areas as the network issues and or others are concerned.
                                    Conclusion
                                    Online learning in this Covid-19 pandemic situation is the
                                  best alternate option for academic students to carry on their
                                  studies in coordination with their teachers. Online learning is a
                                  growing and exciting new way to learn about almost anything.
                                  And as network technology is developing day by day, online
                                  learning would be the most common way of taking classes like
                                  today’s offline classes.
                                    Today’s online learning opportunities offer everything from
                                  one-hour live workshops to online degrees. So, if there is a
                                  course you have always wanted to take or a skill you have
                                  always wanted to learn, but you have not had the time to attend
                                  a traditional face-to-face class or there hasn’t been an opportunity
                                  near you, then online learning might be your answer.
                                    However, learning online is different from learning in a
                                  face-to-face setting, and it is important to think about your
                                  goals, your needs and your interests before committing yourself
                                  to something. You also need to think about the time you have
                                  available, your comfort level with using technology and the
                                  equipment that is at your disposal. As we all become more
                                  familiar with computers and computer access becomes
                                  increasingly common, online learning will continue to open
                                  doors and offer learning opportunities for those who are
                                  interested.

                                  Abstract:
                                  Today’s  education  system  has  brought  much  advancement  in
                                  using  digital  tools  to reach the students learning and
                                  understanding in simple method of representation via automation.
                                  In this global pandemic situation, most of the educational
                                  institutions all around the globe have switched over to digital
                                  mode of operation that is  remote based learning approach.  In
                                  conventional system of education, students  have  faced  lot  of
                                  pressures  in  listening  to  the  normal  mode  of  class  room  teach
                                  ing during direct interaction, but online or remote based
                                  education learning  has  given  some  pace  and  flexibility  to
                                  visualize  the  concepts  as  well  as  process  much  better  than
                                  normal  black  board  teaching  style.  Through  digital  mode,  we
                                  are  able  to  improve  much  better  in  presenting  the  concepts
                                  through video simulation in lesser time span, whereas in old or
                                  traditional method of education, teacher has to put more effort
                                  in  teaching  the  concepts  to  students.  But  today’s  students  are
                                  less  attentive  in  nature.  They  can  only  able  to  see  visually

                                    Introduction:
                                    Modern technological advancements like Sensors, IOT
                                  (Internet of Things) and smart automation have influenced the
                                  present education system in several ways. Today’s  education
                                  systems are highly focused towards the digital platform through
                                  virtual  communication systems. In India, still there are some
                                  problems with the internet protocol or communication systems,
                                  lack  of  skilled  persons,  poor  economic  culture, slow internet
                                  speed etc. These are the issues present in the Indian education
                                  system.  Industry  Revolution 4.0  will  definitely  create  a  big
                                  impact  on  the  Indian  education  system  that  will  transform  the
                                  future  of  advanced  technology  through  visual  method. The
                                  present system is not much beneficial to the students of Indian
                                  nation still students are following the olden method of education
                                  that  is  memorizing  the  concepts.  In  future,  such  type  of
                                  conventional education pattern will not help students. This has
                                  increased the remote based learning through mobiles and
                                  laptops with increased  bandwidth, but still in India from
                                  technology point of view, people from rural villages facing lot
                                  of connectivity issues and bandwidth problems during the past
                                  few  months  in the pandemic crisis. Before going for any
                                  change or transformation in the education process, first we have
                                  to  fix  the  mind  for  preparedness,  which  is  common  for  all  .
                                    Then the next challenge is the preparedness for updating the
                                  skill in learning the new embedded technologies and then at
                                  last economic challenge is the vital thing, which is to be taken
                                  with more importance. Creativity is the main aspect in industrial

                                  revolution 4.0. Only trained and skilled peoples can be able to
                                  control the innovation and process mechanism in education
                                  system. According to Education 4.0, students need to be trained
                                  not by conventional teaching but with the latest form of
                                  teaching via experiencing. This is the aim of remote based
                                  education system. Both Education 4.0 & Industry 4.0 must be
                                  aligned together in order to create job opportunities in more
                                  demand. The future education system will be more transparent
                                  in nature, in which all the information will be stored in the
                                  form of cloud. So, the user can able to access the information
                                  from the cloud data according to their wish.
                                    Education 4.0 improves the freedom of learning and also
                                  freedom to innovate, think and implement by proving promising
                                  results in any fields. So, both students and educationalists have
                                  equal responsibility to sharpen the world by bringing quick
                                  changes through major advancements in the field. Education
                                  4.0 brings many job opportunities to students in line with latest
                                  technological tools like Machine learning, Deep learning and
                                  Data science, etc. Education 4.0 will bring the change in the
                                  curriculum design and pedagogical methods practiced in teaching
                                  and learning process. Education 4.0 will have increased
                                  advantage in digital skills and Science, Technology, Engineering
                                  & Mathematics. As stated by Lloyds Bank in 2019 nearly 22%
                                  of the people in UK are lacking in digital proficiency that is
                                  considered to be more essential in order to do the day-to-day
                                  professional activities.

                                    Also, in future it was estimated that AI (Artificial Intelligence)
                                  will have a profound role to play in the field of higher
                                  education and also to what extent all universities will be
                                  converted to have smart campus in improving the teaching and
                                  learning quality. Education 4.0 requires a new strategy to
                                  prepare human resources in order to compete in the age of
                                  digital technology. The fourth Industrial revolution has shown
                                  impact in many several ways specifically in education sectors.
                                  The influence of industry 4.0 concept has brought more advanced
                                  transformations both in National and International level.

                                    Both researchers and industrialists can work in cooperative
                                  manner to find solutions for many issues in the digital world of
                                  education. Education 4.0 does not require a teacher to teach the
                                  concepts in education institutions, instead remote based learning
                                  system is followed. Whereas the role of teachers will have
                                  slight change in the environment of Education 4.0. The new
                                  paradigm shift in Education 4.0 – Digital era will motivate to
                                  have a greater number of online courses for the students to
                                  enhance their skills through virtual mode of education. Similarly,
                                  teachers will also develop the core competencies towards
                                  teaching and learning through various ICT tools for simplified
                                  method of teaching and learning process. Even though education
                                  4.0 has many advantages, at the same time readiness to accept
                                  for change is said to be one of the main challenges in the
                                  modern system. So, Education 4.0 must set its objectives in line
                                  with the goals of Industry 4.0 so that both educational institutions
                                  and Industries can work together for the betterment of student’s
                                  future.

                                  (Industry 4.0). Use of emerging technologies like AI (Artificial
                                  Intelligence), Smart automation, etc. have increased the high
                                  demand in education sectors in the recent times. The present
                                  education system is planned to shift towards virtual mode by
                                  training the students as well as staffs to work in man/machine
                                  interface system using smart robotics. Before going for the shift
                                  in the education system, it requires recent updates of technologies
                                  from students’ side and also from the faculty side. Education
                                  4.0 aims for cooperative teaching and learning process through
                                  online (virtual classroom). Tandon  and  Tandon  (2020)  have
                                  studied the basic literature about Education 4.0  based  on  their
                                  observation.  It  is  known from the fact that the present 21 st
                                  century needs a lot of skills and talents from  the  young
                                  engineers,  who  are  graduating  every  year  from  the  leading
                                  technical  uni-  versities.  Also,  the  authors  have  stated  that  the
                                  activities  of  human  intervention  will  be  gradually  replaced  by
                                  smart automation control system. In the present advancement of
                                  Industry 4.0, all the schools and colleges have to relook their
                                  education stan- dards in teaching and learning process through
                                  creating massive job requirements  by  upgrading  the  skills  of
                                  students  from  the  school  level  onwards.
                                    Kb and Avinash (2019) have described the need of Education
                                  4.0 – Digital trans-formation. In India, the importance of
                                  Education 4.0 is still said to be a dream concept. In future, it
                                  may come very rapidly to Indian education sectors. Education
                                  4.0 is preparing the students for the future leadership. People
                                  from India still have the hesitation to change towards the
                                  modern advancements in future. India has different geographical
                                  locations and the people are separated by languages, various
                                  cultures, etc. First of all, people must have proper intensive
                                  training towards the modern transformation in education systems.
                                  Since, the students from rural background will have some
                                  difficulties in using the digital platform effectively, enough care
                                  to be taken to groom the rural people for education 4.0.
                                  Hariharasudan and Kot (2018) have collected the basic data
                                  about languages that are used to communicate the medium in

                                  digital representation. In this paper, they reviewed the literature
                                  about digital English and its significant importance in education
                                  4.0. Based on the comprehensive review, it is observed that
                                  most of the literature works are done in Digital English in the
                                  past. So, one must identify the proper language to communicate
                                  the ideas using modern digital tools and techniques. Kumar et
                                  al. (2020) have focused towards the basic functions of Industry
                                  4.0 and Education 4.0 in general sense. In the first few lines,
                                  they narrated about the basic functions of Industry 4.0 and its
                                  core importance with respect to Industrial Revolution. Then in
                                  the second phase, the focus is made on education system and
                                  its modern trends in the present environment. They took
                                  various parameters like individual’s impact on education 4.0,
                                  Impact of education 4.0 in curriculum design and framework
                                  and Impact in teaching methods. These are the different
                                  parameters chosen by the them based on that assessment that is
                                  carried out from various persons in order to know the perception
                                  of Education 4.0. From the assessment, it is clear that still
                                  everyone has to shift and move towards the change in future.
                                  The Industry 4.0 implementation in education system will bring
                                  radical change in all processes and functions.
                                    Singh and Tilak (2020) contributed their ideas in improving
                                  the employability skills of graduates by integrating Industry
                                  4.0. The authors have fixed two differ- ent hypotheses in order
                                  to measure the significant difference between each of the
                                  factors, viz. (i) Improper implementation of skill development
                                  affects employability and (ii) Less knowledge teachers, students
                                  and technicians have made impact in poor employability).
                                  Based on the hypotheses, they proposed education 4.0 model to
                                  improve the effectiveness of education.  Therefore, the aim of
                                  education  4.0  is  to equip the students for job creation rather
                                  than job seeking. Goel et al. (2020)  have  compared the
                                  relationship between Industry 4.0 and Education 4.0 in highly
                                  comprehensive way. In Industry 4.0, the product and processes
                                  are done through automation  with the help of emerging

                                  to the advancement of Industry 4.0 in Education sector, dramatic
                                  improvements in the learning methods, teaching styles followed,
                                  etc.  have  happened.  Education  4.0  has  brought  better  learning
                                  outcomes  in  education.
                                    Jadhav et al. (2019) have introduced the different roles of
                                  Industry 4.0 in various sectors. Some of the primary roles
                                  focused here are education 4.0, it’s special fea- tures and its
                                  challenges. In present education, the need of education 4.0 has
                                  brought many roles, viz. (i) Upliftment of teachers, (ii) Setting
                                  course curriculum with indus- trial requirements and (iii)
                                  Collaborate with Industry players. These are some of the
                                  specific roles mentioned in the literature. At the overall, the
                                  Education 4.0 must have good infrastructure and data security
                                  for successful implementation.

                                    Review of Education 4 0  towards  international  level
                                    This section presents review of literature of education 4.0
                                  at  international  level:
                                    Bonfield et al. (2020) have worked on Education 4.0 before
                                  COVID19. In this work, they reviewed about education 4.0 in
                                  UK based and other International universities. They discussed
                                  about the potential benefits and the use of Education 4.0
                                  through case studies followed in UK (University of Bath),
                                  Singapore (Nanyang Technical University) and Australia (Deakin
                                  University). These are some of the universities taken for careful
                                  study regarding the implementation of Education 4.0 in
                                  International level. Bonfield et al. (2020) focused on orientation
                                  of Education 4.0 – Future based education in Vietnam. In
                                  Industry 4.0, people will not talk about Qualifications, instead
                                  people will talk about value they perceived through training
                                  and learning process. Education 4.0 tries to have more focus on
                                  self-study, self-empowerment and creativity from all learning
                                  groups. The future Teachers in Education 4.0 environment have
                                  to teach how to perform self-learning process within the
                                  students instead of detailed explanation. Through Virtual mode


                                                                                     171]]></page><page Index="173"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  of Education, students can able to self-learn on their own with
                                  the support of remote based virtual assistants. This article talks
                                  about the changes in education system in future.

                                    Lawrence et al. (2019) focused towards the strength and
                                  weakness of Education 4.0 in Higher Education system of
                                  Malaysia. Even though Education 4.0 proves to be more
                                  efficient in nature, at the same time, it has some disadvantages
                                  during implementation stage. The commonly observed problem
                                  is resistance to change is very high among several peoples in
                                  Malaysian University. Most of the lecturers in Malaysian
                                  universities felt that Education 4.0 will disengage the physical
                                  contact between students and faculties away from regular
                                  classroom culture. This study  provides various insights about
                                  the strength and weakness of Education 4.0 to the  authors  by
                                  collecting  many  questionnaire  surveys.  Hussin  (2018)  have
                                  addressed the importance of Education 4.0 in the global level in
                                  the period of  fourth  Industrial  Revolution.  In  Education  4.0,
                                  both  people  and  technology  are  aligned  together  for  the
                                  betterment  of  quality  education.  In  the  present  21 st  century,
                                  skills are highly needed for the teachers in order to handle the
                                  classes  effectively  instead  of  teaching the  concepts.  So,
                                  Education 4.0 is said to be synonymous with visual classroom
                                  management  system,  which  nurtures  the  creativity  and
                                  understanding  of  concepts  with  better  knowledge.
                                    Hamdoni et al. (2019) have taken a case study from higher
                                  education institutes of Philippine. Based on the review from
                                  several databases, they tried to bridge the gap between Education
                                  4.0 & Industry 4.0. The following are the various attributes dis-
                                  cussed in the review such as education facilities, Technological
                                  Advancements with industry tie-up and most importantly
                                  research. Martín et al. (2019) carried out various literature
                                  works on smart education (Education 4.0).
                                    Smart education means moving the technology in forward
                                  direction with lot of hope in improving the quality of education

                                  on the institution level ranging from higher education to
                                  primary education level in addition to that they collected data
                                  about various technologies from various leading Journals.
                                  Moreover, in this work, they analyzed the trend of smart
                                  education in global level.
                                    Piccarozzi et al. (2018)have focused on recent trends in
                                  Industry 4.0 in management education studies or business
                                  schools . Industry 4.0 is said to be a new theme for Management
                                  scholars and Business Economics Discipline people. A number
                                  of contributions related to both management studies and
                                  Industries are taken in the review of literature. In this review,
                                  data are collected from major academic and research databases
                                  to aim for the strong objectives and functions of organization.
                                  Rohayani et al. (2015) have conducted survey on the
                                  preparedness towards online education. Based on the Literature
                                  review, the authors studied about the individual skills and
                                  attitudes as common factors towards E learning readiness. Each
                                  Institution will have different skills and attitudes. So, it is
                                  advisable to carefully study the attitudes of various persons and
                                  based on that carefully set the objectives for E learning
                                  environment.
                                    Pardiñan and Loremia (2020) observed from the literature
                                  that technology advancement leads to improve the future vision
                                  towards education process around the globe. As referred from
                                  the literature, it is known from the fact that education 4.0
                                  brings new opportunities to the young talents and professionals
                                  from various sectors. The current education system is marching
                                  towards the developmental transformation by improving the
                                  system of education methods in simple way. So, from the
                                  literature, it is stated that Education 4.0 can be named as
                                  Systematic Computer Assisted Learning & Environment. From
                                  the review, it is observed that computer assisted learning has
                                  advantages like self- centred learning, Getting the learning

                                  model in order to provide suitable guidelines, which are to be
                                  followed by both educational Institutions and Industries. The
                                  main purpose of constructing business model is to create a
                                  reference model for conducting the mode of business practices.

                                    The above model clearly describes about the virtual model
                                  of Education 4.0 and its significant impact under various entities.
                                  From the above model, the following entities are listed below.
                                    1. Student’s Positivity towards Industry 4.0.
                                    2. Administration Willingness.

                                    3. Internet Accessibility.
                                    4. Allocation  of  Funds.
                                    5. Development of Infrastructure.

                                    6. Industrial Collaboration


















                                    All the entities from the above model are treated as most
                                  equal to each other, if student’s engagement is poor, the
                                  outcome will be affected in high level and also if the

                                       agreed  to  the  transformation  change  in  the  education
                                       system through virtual mode of  communication.
                                    2. Minority  of  the  respondents  nearly  15  have  felt  that
                                       network issues, Level of teaching and student’s receiving
                                       end  are  neutral  in  nature.
                                    3. Only very few respondents (3 Respondents) have shown
                                       their dislike towards  digital education  system.
                                    From the above inferences, it is noted that organization must
                                  have high speed internet facility in addition to that management
                                  must train the faculties and students to  have good virtual
                                  interaction through online mode of communication. The future
                                  focus  of  Education  4.0  will  be  based  on  the  usage  of
                                  technological tools like Data Science, IOT, Smart Automation,
                                  etc. Using these tools, faculties have to impart skills to  the
                                  students through project-based learning environment.

                                    5. Conclusion
                                    In  this  paper,  an  attempt  has  been  made  to  review  the
                                  current status of Education 4.0 in national as well as in global
                                  scenarios.  The  research  is  conducted  by  means  of  Google
                                  survey from various respondents like students, faculties and
                                  Industry Professionals.  Based  on  the  model,  the  following
                                  entities are suggested for possible implementation for E learning
                                  environment. So, it is important to note that management must
                                  develop more allocation of funds to introduce digital mode of
                                  education system in the institution level. Also, they should
                                  create willingness from student’s side  to  adopt  themselves  in
                                  modern  classroom  system.  At  last,  the  Institution  and  Indus-
                                  tries both must work in collaborative environment by going for
                                  project-based learning method.

                                  Due to COVID-19 induced lockdown, India, on a larger scale,
                                  has experienced the enthusiastic experimentation of the online
                                  education. Not only academic institutions, but the corporate, as
                                  well as, the government bodies too, in many cases, have begun
                                  the trainings and/or meetings through online mode. In this
                                  perspective researcher reveals that the Post-Pandemic situation
                                  offers the scope to impact and transform the entire gamut of the
                                  education system.
                                    Key words: Online learning, Teaching, Post Pandemic.
                                    Introduction
                                    Due to lockdown and COVID-19, India, on a larger scale,
                                  has experienced the enthusiastic experimentation of the online
                                  education. Not only academic institutions, but the corporate, as

                                  well as, the government bodies too, in many cases, have begun
                                  the trainings and/or meetings through online mode. It is like the
                                  Royal Bengal Tiger has got the taste of the human blood. So
                                  the thirst will be increased on an accelerating basis. So it can
                                  surely be assumed, that, the zeal for online education will not
                                  be ended after the pandemic period, rather, it will reach a
                                  higher level. So schools, colleges, institutions, Universities and
                                  training centers have to be ready for the upcoming future,
                                  where people will more be interested to learn through online.

                                    To have the process successful, the Government needs to be
                                  strict in the matter of cyber security. At the same time, there
                                  must be enough opportunities, so that, the common masses can
                                  enrich themselves in the processes of virtual communication.
                                  As people will be interested in using the online platforms, they
                                  should be introduced with several online educational programs,
                                  for updating and/or upgrading themselves. If this mission
                                  becomes successful, the State will obviously be prosperous
                                  enough by the presence of educated persons.
                                    Online education is the call for the day. So to make the day
                                  bright and beautiful, the system has to help its human beings to
                                  overcome the unnecessary doubts and confusions, for, the
                                  future stands for the online communication, in every way.
                                    India, a country of universalism, having had her political
                                  independence since 1947, has been practicing an elitist education
                                  system, where, the brand name of the institution, in many
                                  cases, have been effective, to judge the student, instead of
                                  testing his/her intelligence in some other ways. That is the
                                  reason, many students, even after having the required skills in
                                  that particular subject, even after having a great knowledge in
                                  his/her particular field(s) of study, even after having the good
                                  marks in the examination(s), concerned, have, in many cases,
                                  been rejected on the interview table, just because they followed
                                  the distance education as their mode(s) of studies.
                                    In the year of 2008, the author of this academic article had
                                  to hear some unpleasant words from a renowned professor,

                                  associated with a famous university in India, that, the application
                                  for the PhD, submitted by the former, mentioned earlier, would
                                  not, however, be granted, for, his MA was through the distance
                                  mode. It was a different issue, that, his score had the ability to
                                  apply or his intellect attracted that professor. But the latter
                                  opined, that, in those cases, that student, would actually, in an
                                  unofficial manner, be said a “No” through the interview process,
                                  because, as per that professor, that university would not be
                                  taking students, from the distance education mode.

                                    Not only that, in the year 2007, when the vacant posts for
                                  the teachers were started to get filled up by the eligible
                                  candidates, by the order of the Government of the State of Uttar
                                  Pradesh, the students, who were having their degrees from
                                  Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU), were, on an
                                  initial basis, being avoided. The situation changed, when some
                                  of those IGNOU alumni went to the court. The online education,
                                  during the pre-pandemic period was, in a nutshell, the synonym
                                  of the distance education. If COVID-19 has any positive
                                  element in its existence, that is, it changed the snob mentality.
                                  As the online mode of education has got its reach in schools,
                                  colleges, universities, as well as, in the corporate trainings too,
                                  now people have, well, begun to accept the reality and in that
                                  manner, the online way of learning is the future, for, people
                                  have realized, that, it is a cost savvy method, which may bring
                                  profit, and at the same time, productivity.

                                    Purpose of the study
                                    Purpose of this scholarly paper is to awaken the common
                                  people about online education, with a tagline, that, online
                                  education stands on the future, and future lies in online
                                  education. On the other hand, this academic article also provides
                                  suggestive measures to do the needful, in this regard. For that,
                                  few case studies have been provided herewith, with an aim,
                                  students doing research on this matter, would be able to
                                  contribute further. This writing has, like a metaphor, like a

                                  education, with its pros and cons, as much is possible within
                                  the determined word limits.
                                    This write up can throw some clear light on the background,
                                  on the reality, and on the problems, associated with online
                                  mode of communication and/or teaching and/or learning and/or
                                  training, based on which the future research can find a pathway,
                                  in the matter of contributing knowledge base in the open ocean
                                  of wisdom.
                                    Background
                                    As has already been discussed in the previous section, that,
                                  India was knowingly or unknowingly following a snob
                                  educational system, based on brand name, and illogical traditions,
                                  the pandemic situation has helped her, at least in the field of
                                  education, to grab some new kind of stepping stones. Indian
                                  education system has always been misunderstood by the common
                                  people. When the author of this academic paper, entered into
                                  the part-time PhD at Jindal Global Business School, O P Jindal
                                  Global University, then he had to face some peculiar comments,
                                  even from the so-called educated masses. The gist, however
                                  was gathered, that, those so-called educated masses do not
                                  know, firstly, the part-time PhD is not equivalent to the PhD in
                                  distance mode, and secondly, in India, PhD is not possible
                                  through the distance mode. There have been many corporate
                                  courses, taught online. But people misunderstood them as the
                                  distance mode of education.
                                    However, right now, i.e., during this post-pandemic period,
                                  it can be observed, that, online education has acted as a
                                  communicating bridge between direct educational process and
                                  the distance education mode, which, in the upcoming future
                                  may bring some good effects, for, the harsh reality, because of
                                  the COVID-19, has changed, in a lot ways, the minds and
                                  mentalities of the common people, where online education is
                                  no more a myth, rather, it is a normal way in the new normal
                                  day. It is not that, that, the online method of education has been

                                  accepted in India, institutionally, during a happy moment. The
                                  fact is, Indian rigidity had no other option, except to accept the
                                  online method of education, to save her future. Whatever the
                                  reason is, it is now an established fact, that, the online method
                                  has got its grips over the Indian education system, and people
                                  have realized the good effects of the online classes.

                                    Observations
                                    If observed thoroughly, with a neutral sense of judgment,
                                  filled by the logical aptitude, it can truly be realized, that, in a
                                  simultaneous manner, we live in two parallel countries, one is
                                  India, and the other one is Bharat. India is naturally sophisticated,
                                  Bharat is socially needy. India is financially rich, Bharat is
                                  economically poor. India is superficially glamorous. Bharat is
                                  naturally glorious. In India, education is a product, whereas, for
                                  Bharat, education is in the practice. India has always ignored
                                  the wealth of Bharat. Lockdown has changed our vision. The
                                  online education has brought these two countries under the
                                  same umbrella of practicality, where Smartphone has turned
                                  into the gateway of enrichment.
                                    The day will come, when the fear of corona virus must go.
                                  But some changes will be seen on that very morning. The mode
                                  of education, the method of learning, the mechanism of training
                                  will be merged in the same horizon through the online teaching.
                                  It will save cost, time, and energy. Earlier an organization used
                                  to call its hundred managers in a meeting. The meeting used to
                                  take place, generally in the head-quarter. The expenses of
                                  travelling, the expenditure of food, as well as, of lodging,
                                  moreover, the time in a lot ways were wasted. But now the
                                  same meeting would be taking place virtually. So cost, time,
                                  and energy will no more be wasted, as it used to be. Similarly,
                                  the educational institutions may add more important courses in
                                  their academia, for, online method of teaching and training will
                                  help them have more profit in lesser efforts. So that extra profit
                                  may be used for some more creative gains.

                                    Research Question:
                                    Each academic paper has a research question, which, the
                                  author tries to find through the analysis, from the examples.
                                  Here, in this article, the author wants to look into the matter,
                                  whether, online learning is a temporary solution during and/or
                                  right after the pandemic era, or it indeed is the parallel source
                                  of revolution in the upcoming future, in India. It is true, that,
                                  people, by and large, have accepted the way of online learning.
                                  What is analyzed here, whether, online guidance gives the same
                                  kind of input, just like the direct way of teaching. After all, this
                                  measure is a helping hand during the period of crisis. That does
                                  not mean, once the crisis will be over, people will, in the same
                                  way be attracted towards and associated with the method of e-
                                  learning. The question is, whether the mode of online teaching
                                  would get the same kind of importance, as it is having right
                                  now, during, as well as, right after the pandemic period of time.

                                    In this regard, the author would recapitulate his conversation
                                  with Ms. Jean Marie Pennington (Jeannie Pennington), a retired
                                  educational counselor from the United States of America (The
                                  State of New Mexico), a mystic mind, who is still, even in her
                                  seventies, working in the corporate level. The author told her
                                  about an Indian case study, where there are two students. First
                                  one is doing a direct MBA (Master of Business Administration).
                                  The other one is busy, doing his job. However, he is also
                                  pursuing a part-time/distance mode of MBA from the same
                                  institution, where he attends the weekend/online classes. In
                                  India, when these two persons will be going for a same job, the
                                  first one, in an unofficial manner, will generally be selected for
                                  the job, because, the common sense says, the first student learnt
                                  more than the second student, for, the first one went through
                                  the direct courses. So it is assumed, that, he devoted more time
                                  in learning. However, Ms. Jeannie Pennington respectfully
                                  differed, and she had few points in favor of her arguments.
                                    1. The first student learnt the academic syllabi only, whereas,
                                       the second student does have the learning from the

                                  186]]></page><page Index="188"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                       academic syllabi, and at the same time, he is having a
                                       working experience.
                                    2. The second student is actually more serious in the field
                                       of knowledge, because he had to learn the same thing,
                                       even after his daily workloads.

                                    3. The second student is more energetic, because, he has
                                       been able to manage his academic study along with the
                                       job, successfully continued on a daily basis.
                                    Whatever the author said, was based on his Indian
                                  experiences, whereas, Ms. Jeannie Pennington was confidently
                                  standing on her American way of living. In this particular
                                  academic paper, the author asks himself, whether the regularized
                                  online way of learning can bring his Indian experiences and
                                  Ms. Jeannie Pennington’s American way of living in a same
                                  field.

                                    Practicality
                                    In the year of 1942, M K Gandhi said, that, the Cripps
                                  Mission had offered him a post-dated cheque. As Mr. Gandhi
                                  was the leader of the common masses, so it can honestly be
                                  assumed, that, by the year of 1942, the common Indian masses
                                  learnt the pros and cons of Banking, though the reality was
                                  something different. Even during this time, the present
                                  Governments, both Union, as well as, State, are relentlessly
                                  working to bring each and every adult citizen under the
                                  Banking services. That does not mean, Mr. Gandhi said
                                  something wrong. He had an idea, that, maximum people
                                  should understand, what exactly he meant by uttering those
                                  historical words.
                                    Same situation arises hereto, where the people of India are
                                  happily on their way(s), to follow the new normal policies of
                                  e-learning, whereas, the common masses of Bharat are still
                                  lagging behind the race, for whom, online learning is yet a
                                  futuristic version of development. Not only that, it is a matter


                                                                                     187]]></page><page Index="189"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  of concern, that, the teachers of the pauper Bharat, in many
                                  cases, do not know the techniques and the technology of using
                                  a Smartphone, to guide their students, through the processes of
                                  virtual learning.
                                    Methodology

                                    While writing this article, the author has gone through
                                  several established literatures, which has been described in the
                                  section of references, here. At the same time, he has collected
                                  the basic ideas from his conversations with several reputed
                                  persons, who are broadly related to the field of academia. His
                                  personal experiences also guided him to frame the research
                                  proposal, accordingly. As he is a man from the genre of
                                  administration, and at the same time, he is doing the PhD in
                                  Management, so at the end of the day, he has thoroughly been
                                  able to mingle his managerial experiences with the academic
                                  ideas.

                                    The methodology to write this academic paper has been a
                                  thorough logical analysis, where the question of “Why” is
                                  prioritized, like, why online education could not have that kind
                                  of importance which it really deserved (?) or why online
                                  learning has been the only option during the time period of
                                  COVID-19 (?) or why the future of education resembles with
                                  online training (?) etc. A scientific mind, based on the neutral
                                  feeling has helped the author, to do the needful. The qualitative
                                  arguments, in this scholarly article, have, undoubtedly, acted as
                                  the sources of being the torch-bearer, to find the truth, in every
                                  sense.

                                    Research Analysis
                                    Virtual way of learning and/or teaching and/or training have
                                  some positive effects, and at the same time, some negative
                                  essences, as well. Through this mode of study cost, time, and
                                  energy can be saved. This form of learning and/or teaching and/
                                  or training has more accessibility to attract the masses. More
                                  courses can be introduced. People can thus become technically

                                  more perfect. The most interesting side, in this regard, is, that,
                                  it can change the mind, the vision, and the thought process
                                  radically.

                                    When one side of the globe is full with light, then the other
                                  side must be filled by darkness. As there are some advantages,
                                  there must, at the same level, be some type of negativity too.
                                  Virtual modes of learning and/or teaching and/or training do
                                  not let the people, attached therewith, mingle among themselves.
                                  So the fellow-feeling may not be generated. Cultural shock may
                                  attack any person, not so advanced, technically, at any point of
                                  time. As maximum people will be using the phone-cam and/or
                                  webcam, some people must feel shaky for not having proper
                                  interiors in their respective houses. This may generate inferior
                                  complex, for sure.

                                    On the other hand, too much dependence on the virtual
                                  world may turn a person unrealistic at some point of time. Fake
                                  news spread through social media, may convince a person,
                                  without any doubt, the result of which must not be pleasant.
                                  This kind of examples we are witnessing in our present society,
                                  on a daily basis, which, at the end of the day, does contribute
                                  destructive elements only.

                                    Realization
                                    Necessity is the mother of invention. When during the
                                  lockdown days, the development was at a stake, right at that
                                  moment, online education got popularity, just like Hrithik
                                  Roshan received a great fate in Kaho Na Pyaar Hain. Once
                                  people have begun to visualize the good effects of online
                                  coaching, the darkness, associated therewith, has to be overcome.
                                  Pornography is a part and parcel of the internet. That does not
                                  mean, we will discontinue the usage of the internet, rather, we
                                  must motivate our thoughts, in the right direction, so that, we
                                  may receive the positive waves only. The happiest thing about
                                  online communication is, one can learn, while he is doing
                                  something else too. It is not always necessary to have the


                                                                                     189]]></page><page Index="191"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  phone-cam or webcam on. So, in that case, a person, even
                                  being in a virtual class and/or meeting, may continue doing
                                  some household tasks, as well. Thus online modes and/or
                                  methods of learning and/or teaching and/or training have, truly
                                  speaking, increased the human activities, in a multi-purpose
                                  manner.
                                    The best way to teach a boy, how to swim, is, to throw him
                                  in water and watch him from a little distance. He will soon be
                                  able to swim across the difficulties. It is true, that, Smartphone
                                  has not yet been a daily friend for all Indians. But once people,
                                  not at all or not that much inclined towards the online modes
                                  of communication, may be because of economic reason and/or
                                  psychological causes, once they will notice, that, without using
                                  the online pathways, they will be lagging behind, they must
                                  continue to upgrade themselves wholeheartedly. The system,
                                  i.e., the state machinery will have to assist those people, in such
                                  a way, so that, they may begin to feel home, while using the
                                  pros and cons of online methods of communication, in the field
                                  of education.

                                    Case Studies
                                    1. A  boy, from the District of Purulia, West Bengal, got
                                       selected in the Medical courses, i.e., MBBS, in the year
                                       of 2020, though, due to the COVID situation, the classes
                                       did not start right at that juncture. However, in the year
                                       of 2021, the Bangalore Medical College, which is pretty
                                       famous in India, gave him two options, where the first
                                       one is to have a direct promotion in the second year,
                                       whereas, the second one has been to begin his Medical
                                       courses right in the year of 2021, as a student of the first
                                       year. Actually the reason behind this might have been
                                       the difficulty of arranging the practical classes through
                                       the online mode. Hence the authority could not manage
                                       to run the said syllabi through an online mode. On the

                                       well as, of the professors, it has become a problem, for

                                       the authority, to deliver direct classes to all the students,
                                       selected, in the academic years of 2020 – 2021, and
                                       2021 – 2022.

                                    2. Bharat Sevashram Sangha, a great charitable socio-
                                       religious institution, which is sincerely involved, with
                                       utmost dedication, in bringing up the poor students from
                                       the marginalized classes of the society, in the residentially
                                       modeled schools, enthusiastically updated its teaching
                                       faculty system in the online version, since the unhappy
                                       incident of that breaking out of the COVID-19. But
                                       many students, though they have been attending the
                                       daily online classes, stopped to pay the fees. If a nation
                                       has wishes, not whims, to stand straight, it surely needs
                                       the cordial cooperation from the side of its citizens too.

                                    3. During this era of the so-called WhatsApp University,
                                       Facebook Institution, Twitter Faculty etc, there have, in
                                       recent times, been so many unfortunate incidents, all
                                       over India, of fake news and fabricated messages to be
                                       viral. Somewhere, there has also been a temporary
                                       degradation of the law & order situation, at least, in the
                                       local level, because of those mishaps. The State machinery
                                       needs to be strict on these issues, so that, online
                                       communicators can, somehow, be fixed responsibilities,
                                       otherwise, the myth of online modus operandi will not
                                       let the nation to be developed in a true sense of maturity.

                                    4. In the name of online transaction, so many people get
                                       cheated, on a daily basis. The Cyber Security needs to be
                                       stronger and more active, and at the same time, there
                                       should be efficiency building mechanism (EBM) on the
                                       run, with an high alert, because, online education is a
                                       part of online communication, and online communication
                                       is totally mixed up with online transaction. If online
                                       education has to spread, then people should be provided
                                       online security too.



                                                                                     191]]></page><page Index="193"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                    5. Online training is becoming the future trend for India, in
                                       each and every job sector. However, the problem is that,
                                       in the hierarchical structure, in the names of online
                                       communication, online training, online meeting etc, the
                                       official formalities often gets ignored. The administrative
                                       people, who, in their professional arena, are to deal with
                                       the daily works, sincerely, under the realms of judicial
                                       obstacles, there, in some important cases, just because of
                                       the increasing level of the trending online communication
                                       and/or online training and/or online meeting, and at the
                                       same moment, due to the absence of properly made and/
                                       or maintained official formalities, in due course of time,
                                       personal responsibilities, may at any point of time, in the
                                       near future, be fixed, before the honorable judiciary and/
                                       or the hierarchy, though, those administrative persons, in
                                       those individual cases, may not be directly liable, at all.
                                       So, it must not ever be forgotten, that, online
                                       dissemination should not discourage the parallel practices
                                       of keeping, as well as, fulfilling the official protocols, on
                                       an urgent basis.

                                    Discussion
                                    There should not be any confusion, regarding the issue, that,
                                  online education will rebuild the nation of India, to a high
                                  extent. There has been a story, that, a teacher wanted to give
                                  the value education to some rogue children. When they were
                                  not eager to come to his school, then, that idealistic teacher
                                  made a practical plan. He began to decorate his school with
                                  colorful designs. Soon, those naughty children were attracted
                                  towards that school, by themselves, seeing the beautiful
                                  decoration of the school, and one by one, they started to enter
                                  into the classroom. In the same way, the Smartphone is the
                                  colorfully beautiful gateway to the new normal education
                                  system. The common masses will get attracted by the Smartphone
                                  first. Then they will be entering into the online educational
                                  premises.


                                  192]]></page><page Index="194"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                    There is another story, which can be related to this ongoing
                                  situation. Once upon a time, there was a remote land, where the
                                  citizens did not have any sort of protective measure to defend
                                  their own community. Suddenly a foreign power attacked their
                                  home, and the local residents found themselves in a great
                                  danger. They began their existential fight with what-so-ever
                                  they could manage, like stones, sticks etc, and surprisingly, at
                                  least for the time being, they were able to resist the foreign
                                  power. Then they realized, that, to have their independence,
                                  they must improve their skills, they should upgrade their
                                  weapons, otherwise there would, at any time, be another
                                  foreign attack. Thus they remained busy in doing so. Similarly,
                                  common people have understood, that, there may, in the unseen
                                  future, break out any other danger, like the Corona virus. As
                                  they have had some benefits, this time, through the usages of
                                  the online education, hence, their instinct will not let them be
                                  away from this developmental equipment, any more, and thus,
                                  there will be the continuation of the online education.
                                    The State has to utilize this golden opportunity, at any cost.
                                  It is already a proven fact, that, people have understood the
                                  facilities of the Smartphone. So any policy, any scheme, any
                                  project has to be an online feature, which can update, as well
                                  as, upgrade the common citizens, irrespective of the caste,
                                  creed, gender, race, age and status. Once people will be more
                                  involved in using the Smartphone, the online communication
                                  will be more fruitful. Once people will religiously be accustomed
                                  with the online communication, they will automatically be
                                  aware of the online education too. Once they will be aware of
                                  the online education, there will be a real revolution, socially,
                                  through the steps of online learning, online teaching, and online
                                  training. Thus the real change will occur in India, in every
                                  aspect.
                                    Suggestions
                                    If online education has to be popularized, then few doubts
                                  should honestly be cleared by the Government. The basic

                                                                                     193]]></page><page Index="195"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  question is how the laboratory oriented works and/or practical
                                  trainings are to be provided. In this context, few direct classes
                                  may be arranged. By doing so, there may not be any more
                                  distance educational concept. The full-time or the part-time
                                  courses may thus be introduced.

                                    Recently, the author was having an intellectual discussion
                                  with his colleague-friend, Dr. Ayan Mukherjee, while the latter
                                  shared an interesting incident from his life, that, in the year of
                                  2013, when he was about to go to Germany, for pursuing his
                                  PhD degree, he told his aged mother, that, if she would like to
                                  be in touch with her son, she would, for the sake of that
                                  communication, have to learn how to operate a computer, and
                                  surprisingly, she succeeded in doing so, because of her passionate
                                  intention to talk to her son. Now we can, well, relate this string
                                  with the main stream of logic, by adding an important suggestion,
                                  that, if there is enough passion, hidden within, then a person
                                  can do impossible. Similarly, the State has to generate the
                                  passion in the hearts and minds of its common citizens, in the
                                  matter of online communication. Once online communication
                                  will become a habit, then online education can easily be
                                  introduced to them.
                                    Another interesting point has been mentioned by Dr. Ayan
                                  Mukherjee, that, every primary school in India must have at
                                  least one digital classroom, where, the students will be attending
                                  at least one class every day, and in that case, each student, from
                                  an early age, will be able to have an inclination towards the
                                  virtual world. Today, in our country, generally we get introduced
                                  with the digital classroom from our graduation days. But it
                                  should, as per the opinion of Dr. Mukherjee, be started, in
                                  every Government school, from the primary level.
                                    The Government has to make the norms, officially, that
                                  there will, henceforth, be no difference between direct and/or
                                  indirect and/or full-time and/or part-time and/or online and/or
                                  distance mode of education, before any interview board. That

                                  surely will act as a goodwill gesture towards the practice of
                                  online education.
                                    Different new courses, on a low cost basis, should be
                                  encouraged, by the Government, through online mode, for the
                                  housewives, the elderly people, etc, so that, the accessibility of
                                  the online study can reach its zenith. The certificates will be
                                  provided to the ones, who-so-ever will successfully clear the
                                  examinations. This move may create a revolutionary motion in
                                  the society.
                                    Loans, with easy terms, may be provided to the entrepreneurs,
                                  who really wish to run the online educational courses for the
                                  commoners. This will bring a rapid change in the educational
                                  system, in India. All Universities are to be motivated to
                                  introduce several online programs, beside the direct academic
                                  ones. The online students should be given chances to visit the
                                  University and/or Institute campuses, at least for a while,
                                  during their academic sessions. The campus tour may, well, be
                                  there, as a part of the syllabus.

                                    Conclusion:
                                    This article, in its limited time and vision, acts like a mirror,
                                  where the research world can see its own face. The criticisms
                                  have been conducted, with a creative sense of responsibility, so
                                  that, the future of online education, can, systematically be a
                                  cost-friendly product, for all the customers, from all strata of
                                  the society. Undoubtedly, the importance and value of online
                                  education cannot be ignored. So the basic motto will be to use
                                  this modus operandi, for a positive reason, for a true purpose,
                                  for a better dream.

                                    It has hereby been stated, silently, in lines between the lines,
                                  that, the authorities will introduce a far more integrated form of
                                  online education, only after meeting up the needs and
                                  requirements of the SWOT  (Strength, Weakness, Opportunity
                                  and Threat) Analysis. That will help the different forms, stages,


                                                                                     195]]></page><page Index="197"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                    Introduction
                                    The world is subject to change and human civilization is no
                                  exception. The civilization started with the cave man and
                                  technology had its first impression when man first invented
                                  weapons with stone for hunting. The knowledge man got
                                  helped him to make life easier. Civilization developed. Man felt
                                  an urge to create new knowledge and pass it to the next
                                  generations. Education developed. Then, people started sharing
                                  things in the form of exchange. Economy developed. The idea
                                  of exchanging things set value of things. The less common
                                  things became costlier. To satisfy the demand of things, man
                                  became busy to think about supply. Increased supply demanded
                                  production. The increase of population became a catalyst. And
                                  necessity became the mother of invention. With the developing
                                  body of knowledge, man started applying it for the sake of
                                  boosting economy. Industry developed. The demand of skilled
                                  and trained people surged to develop industry. New educational
                                  fields came into existence. New technologies developed. Now,
                                  technology becomes an area of study. In this way, education
                                  and economy, education and industry, and education and
                                  technology got amalgamated with each other. Industry as well
                                  as education was revolutionized. In present day, civilization is
                                  transforming into a knowledge society and we are going
                                  through a knowledge era. Today’s technology revolution has
                                  begot the conception of Industry 4.0 in industrial economy
                                  sector and Education 4.0 in educational sector.

                                    The Evolution of Industrial Revolution
                                    It is nothing but cotton that has changed the dimension of
                                  economy from agrarian to industrial. Cotton industry is believed
                                  to be the first industry in the world and its progress gave birth
                                  to an epoch-making phenomenon called Industrial Revolution
                                  (IR). Most scholars agree that England underwent the world’s
                                  first Industrial Revolution around 1760–1830. This episode
                                  transformed England’s economy from one dominated by
                                  agriculture and trade to one fuelled by factories and fossil fuels.

                                  A host of other changes – such as urbanization, expansion of
                                  markets, economic growth, and alterations in social relations –
                                  rode into the world along with industrialization. Many other
                                  countries have since followed Britain’s lead, and modernizers
                                  around the world have seen industrialization as the key to
                                  economic and social progress (Russel, 2011). The steam engine
                                  powered factories in the nineteenth century, electrification led
                                  to mass production in the early part of the twentieth century,
                                  and industry became automated in the 1970s (Rubmann et al,
                                  2015). The First Industrial Revolution got its force with the use
                                  of water and steam powered engine in 1784. The Second
                                  Industrial Revolution took place when the aim of mass
                                  production was achieved using electrical energy from around
                                  1870. The Third Industrial Revolution occurred when computer
                                  was introduced in the manufacturing process in the form of
                                  Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) and IT systems for
                                  Automation around 1970. Then the idea of Fourth Industrial
                                  Revolution popped up with the philosophy of applying internet,
                                  data mining, artificial intelligence, machine learning, data
                                  analytics and Cyber-Physical System (CPS) in the field of
                                  manufacturing process. “Industry 4.0” is the synonym for the 4-
                                  th industrial revolution in a general understanding. The term
                                  “Industry 4.0” was first used in a high-tech-strategy project of
                                  the German government in 2011 at the Hannover Fair (Glistau
                                  et al, 2018).

                                    Industry 4.0: From Technological Viewpoint:
                                    In manufacturing industry, Industry 4.0 implies the shift of
                                  approach from mass production to individualized and customized
                                  production. It is possible only with the help of advanced
                                  technology. This advancement has been radically changing the
                                  whole scenario of the industrial development. Industry 4.0
                                  represents a major application domain for big data and advanced
                                  analytics in order to exploit the huge amounts of data generated
                                  across the industrial value chain (Groger, 2018). From the first
                                  Industrial revolution to third one it took nearly 100 years in
                                  average, but the fourth industrial revolution took only around
                                  forty years to happen. It clearly exhibits the pace of technological
                                  advancement. Now, we are in the midst of a fourth wave of
                                  technological advancement: the rise of new digital industrial
                                  technology known as Industry 4.0, a transformation that is
                                  powered by nine foundational technology advances (Rubmann
                                  et al, 2015). The nine aspects include big data and analytics,
                                  autonomous robots, simulation, system integration, internet of
                                  things, cyber security and cyber physical system, the cloud,
                                  additive manufacturing, and augmented reality.

                                    Industry 4.0: From Economic Viewpoint
                                    Productivity: During the next five to ten years, Industry 4.0
                                  will be embraced by more companies, thereby boosting
                                  productivity across all manufacturing sectors. Productivity
                                  improvements on conversion costs, which exclude the cost of
                                  materials, will range from 15 to 25 percent. When the materials
                                  costs are factored in, productivity gains of 5 to 8 percent will
                                  be achieved. These improvements will vary by industry.
                                  Industrial-component manufacturers stand to achieve some of
                                  the biggest productivity improvements (20 to 30 percent), for
                                  example, and automotive companies can expect increases of 10
                                  to 20 percent.
                                    Revenue Growth:   Industry 4.0 will also drive revenue
                                  growth. Manufacturers’ demand for enhanced equipment and
                                  new data applications, as well as consumer demand for a wider
                                  variety of increasingly customized products, will drive additional
                                  revenue growth and will help to enhance GDP.

                                    Employment:   The trend towards greater automation will
                                  displace some of the often low-skilled laborers who perform
                                  simple, repetitive tasks. At the same time, the growing use of
                                  software, connectivity, and analytics will increase the demand
                                  for employees with competencies in software development and
                                  IT technologies, such as mechatronics experts with software
                                  skills. (Mechatronics is a field of engineering that comprises
                                  multiple engineering disciplines.) This competency
                                  transformation is one of the key challenges ahead.

                                    Investment:  Adapting production processes to incorporate
                                  Industry 4.0 will require a huge investment. As technology is
                                  making production easier and less time consuming, it will cut
                                  the production cost also. As a result, investors will gladly
                                  accept this revolution and the amount of investment will rise.
                                    The Evolution of Educational Revolution
                                    Like industrial revolutions education also went through a lot
                                  of changes over time to come to its present form. The priority

                                  of education and method of teaching-learning has transformed
                                  remarkably. Even, UNESCO has been changing its goals from
                                  Education For All (EFA) in The Dakar Framework in April
                                  2000 to Universal Primary Education in Millennium
                                  Development Goals (MDGs), especially MDG to Quality
                                  Education in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It has
                                  been a long way from illiterate to technologically skilled
                                  people. Starting from Education 1.0, which focused on skilling
                                  the masses and removing illiteracy through in-formal teaching
                                  methods, the world witnessed a changeover to practical learning
                                  tools in Education 2.0. The ‘process’  of education delivery
                                  developed—to impart mass teaching around a university system
                                  with fixed and rigid structures—along with bringing in a
                                  culture of research. Responding to the macro-environmental
                                  changes, the world witnessed a massive demand for education
                                  with the emergence of Education 3.0 (ED 3.0). The major
                                  transformation in ED 3.0 was focused on the changing roles of
                                  a teacher fused with the new digital tools (Harkins, 2008).
                                  Technology became the connecting thread of the entire world,
                                  and the education system became more transparent and seamless.
                                  The twentieth century saw the development of classrooms, and
                                  more technologically advanced tools were employed in the
                                  classroom (O’Doherty, 2009).

                                    Education 4.0: A  New Perspective
                                    Industry 4.0 has been a great deal in the past years as it is
                                  known to be the latest revolution in the industrial field.
                                  Moreover, this revolution leaves an inevitable impact to the
                                  other fields such as education which originates a new term of
                                  Education 4.0. (Maria, 2016). The creative business solutions,
                                  budding start-up culture and the new educational reforms
                                  across the world have created new paradigms in society (Ibarra,
                                  Ganzarain, &Igartua, 2018). The new age of education is
                                  fuelled by media, the Internet and social media technologies,
                                  and is affecting our way of interaction and living (Buasuwan,
                                  2018). Businesses today are embracing technology at a rapid
                                  pace and creating a pool of new jobs; thus, there is a paradigm
                                  shift in the skill set required. In short, the entire concept of
                                  Education 4.0 revolves around the industrial revolution reflecting
                                  how the education system should be aligned parallel to the
                                  trends in the industry. It is considered as the fourth Educational
                                  Revolution. The Education 4.0 presents before us a new model
                                  of education using new tools of Information Communication
                                  Technology (ICT), a new type of curriculum, new methods of
                                  teaching-learning process.
                                    Changing the core philosophy of the education system,
                                  which was dependent on teachers, Education 4.0 brings the
                                  learner to the core. The new education model, focused on
                                  competencies and skill sets, is aimed at creating knowledge
                                  workers for future jobs. Education 4.0 is the roadmap to bridge
                                  the Industry 4.0 expectations, guided by innovative teaching
                                  pedagogies and conducive learning environment. Opportunities
                                  available worldwide need to be accessible to learners—matching
                                  prospects with learners’ capabilities and skill sets is of paramount
                                  importance.

                                    More Formative Test:  Due to adherence to blended and
                                  flipped learning, both online and offline assessments are
                                  used to assess learners’ achievements. Project-based learning
                                  prefers projects, assignments, and fieldwork, which gives
                                  more importance to formative tests. The way in which

                                    Continuous Teachers Training: Education 4.0 is all about
                                  getting updated about the new skills. A  teacher always has to
                                  be a tech savvy to manage teaching-learning process.  Hence,
                                  teacher training should take place continuously.

                                    Teacher  as a Mentor   and Facilitator: Education 4.0
                                  considers teacher as a mentor and facilitator. The teacher helps
                                  learners to construct their own knowledge. Instructors are well-
                                  equipped with digital learning tools helping student in the self-

                                    Learner-centric Education: According to Education 4.0,
                                  the focus of teaching-learning is shifted from teacher to learner.
                                  As a result, the curriculum is made focusing learner at the
                                  centre.

                                    Peer-based Learning: Peers become very significant in the
                                  learning process in Education 4.0. The students learn together,
                                  along with their peer group, while the teachers assume the role
                                  of facilitators in this learning process.

                                  engineering and mathematics) subjects are given priority to
                                  cope up with the future trends.

                                    Tech-enabled Classroom: Education 4.0 demands the
                                  classroom to be equipped with access to internet and other
                                  technological tools.

                                  cognitive flexibility. In the future, every individual must bear
                                  the capability to know where and when to use the technology.
                                  They must be critical thinkers, problem solvers, innovators,
                                  leaders to take proper advantage of the Industry 4.0. They must

                                  the headlines dominating the last two decades of the educational
                                  development. All of them are strongly influenced and conditioned
                                  by the Internet phenomenon. Of course, this list is still far from
                                  being complete. One could continue with numerous more

                                  2020).

                                    Preparedness and Skill Set for  Both the Teachers and
                                  Students in the Digital World
                                    The evolution of industry 4.0, led to the change from
                                  conventional to digital-based technology. Therefore, educators
                                  need to continuously improve their skills in line with the new
                                  era. Learning materials and methods need to be adapted, using
                                  online or digital-based techniques (Handitya 2018 in Marzuki,
                                  2020; Dahlan, 2018).
                                    Learning is an interactive process, using the right educational
                                  resources in a confined environment. During this pandemic, the
                                  emphasis is placed on active students that tend to obtain
                                  educational material from other resources. However, educational
                                  institutions need to ensure that students are included in the
                                  evaluation process of any adopted teaching medium to provide
                                  the necessary feedback to improve the process.
                                    In the contemporary world of fast changing technology and
                                  information overload, students need to be trained and not
                                  taught. They should learn how to access relevant information,
                                  rather than the teacher offering to them the information in a
                                  rigid structure. Educators should always bear this in mind that,
                                  students are not alike and they don’t have the same starting
                                  point. Education 4.0 needs to be aligned with industry 4.0 so
                                  that; the students should be made capable to grab job
                                  opportunities in the contemporary world. As digitalization
                                  increases its effects in modern manufacturing, producing
                                  promising results, more and more companies are marching
                                  towards integrating industry 4.0 technologies in their systems.
                                  The applications are targeting all the steps of design and
                                  production, exploiting the increasing acceptance of mobile
                                  device applications and internet of things and the advanced
                                  connectivity capabilities offered by modern networks (Hermann,
                                  M., Pantek, T., & Otto, B. 2016).

                                    In this new era of technological advancement, a learner
                                  needs to develop some essential skills for their future career.
                                  These skills include complex problem solving, critical thinking
                                  & creativity, people management, cooperating with others,

                                    On the other hand, a teacher or instructor needs some skills
                                  to accomplish the teaching-learning process. The skill set
                                  includes the capability to create the video and audio content, to
                                  create visually engaging content, to use more social media to
                                  create content, to use blogs to create participatory content, to
                                  use social bookmarking websites, to create engaging
                                  presentations, to create non-traditional quizzes, to create digital
                                  portfolios, and to manipulate digital devices.

                                  skills and competences represent an important and powerful
                                  shift in education. Momentum is building as countries, states,
                                  provinces and school systems re-write curricular and learning
                                  goals to align with deep learning and new pedagogies for 21st
                                  century skills and competencies. Intensive efforts are underway
                                  to re-design education systems to increase the scalability of
                                  new pedagogies and technology-enhanced learning by re-thinking
                                  leadership roles and creating enabling conditions for whole
                                  system change.
                                    What has changed, perhaps, is that knowledge is now
                                  recognized as being at least as important as capital (physical
                                  and financial) and natural resources as a source of economic
                                  growth. In short, knowledge is now regarded as a national
                                  economic asset and the basis of national competitive advantage.
                                  Accordingly, education at all levels, and especially higher
                                  education, with its potential to enhance productivity through
                                  research, is seen as the global panacea to economic policy. As
                                  one of the major areas of public policy investment, governments
                                  around the world, in both advanced and developing economies,
                                  are restructuring education systems, often in transparent terms
                                  that reflect the new policy template of the ‘knowledge economy’
                                  which is nothing but utilization of knowledge and skill for
                                  economic progress (Peters, 2003). This amalgamation of
                                  economy and education has helped each other to flourish. As a
                                  result, education has taken the form of an industry. With the

                                  help of technology, new EdTech companies are popping up in
                                  a huge number.
                                    Conclusion
                                    ICT is a veritable and effective tool for futuristic education.
                                  The future of our world will largely depend on technology. In
                                  purview of the pandemic situation, online education has gained
                                  a huge momentum. It is not only serving the purpose of
                                  delivering education but also preparing skilled persons for the
                                  future. Online learning has developed into an important means
                                  of income because of its ability to improve the quality of
                                  education with minimum resources and infrastructure (Aldholay
                                  et al., 2019). The characteristics of industry 4.0 have increased
                                  the competitiveness through smart equipment, demographic
                                  changes, energetic efficiency and urban production. The business
                                  environment of smart factory, machine communications (M2M)
                                  and smart products are a subcomponent of the cyber-physical
                                  systems (Greengard, 2015, Kayermann, 2014). Thus, the youth
                                  have to keep pace in response to the current social changes.
                                  The future development of the civilization largely depends on
                                  the education system and skilled persons. The Sustainable
                                  Development Goal 4 aims to provide quality education to all by
                                  2030. The Education 4.0 has the potential to provide the
                                  accessibility and quality education with the help of
                                  technologically sophiticated tools. The community development
                                  is also oriented with education. According to European
                                  Commission (2015), the industry 4.0 and the contemporary
                                  education 4.0 have to analyse the potential of this wide scale
                                  rollout of integrated smart cities and community’s solutions.
                                  The digital revolution is more experienced by paradigm shift to
                                  artificial intelligence (AI), big data, and connectivity. The
                                  evolution of Industrial Revolution and Educational Revolution
                                  to this digitized and automated world has become ready to
                                  witness the trained future man with a lot of technological skills
                                  (Howard, 2018).

                                  The whole world is undergoing the devastating effects of
                                  pandemic situation due to COVID-19. As education sector was
                                  involved technology in the form of ICT came to rescue from
                                  the young generation from the crisis. The result of
                                  implementation of technology in education seemed fruitful as a
                                  new and alternative approach to the educational scenario of the
                                  whole world. However analysis of the surging cases of
                                  psychological problems during pandemic indicates that the
                                  excessive use of internet and technological devices like
                                  smartphones is laying a long-term impact on the mental health
                                  of the learners as well as the common users. New terms like
                                  Internet Addiction Disorder and Smartphone Addiction Disorder
                                  are emerging in the field of psychological disorders. Moreover,
                                  the excessive use of technology is ushering in nightmares of
                                  job insecurity in future.

                                    Key words: pandemic, ICT, remote education, psychological
                                  problems, insecurity.
                                    Introduction
                                    The word “pandemic” is not new to the world. The word
                                  “pandemic” comes from the combination of the Greek “pan-”
                                  means “all” and “demos” means “people or population”. So,
                                  from the Greek word “pandemos” the English equivalent word
                                  “pandemic” has been derived. A pandemic is an epidemic of an
                                  infectious disease that has spread across a large region, for
                                  instance multiple continents or worldwide, affecting a substantial
                                  number of people. The world has seen a lot of pandemics
                                  before but in case of novel corona virus it was different. The
                                  virus SARS-CoV-2 has changed the whole situation. It is a new
                                  type of virus; hence it is termed as novel. The virus spreads
                                  more quickly than it was supposed. People were warned about
                                  its contagious nature by health officials and World Health
                                  Organization (WHO). As the virus was first identified in 2019,
                                  it was named Corona Virus Disease 2019. In short, it is widely
                                  known as COVID-19.
                                    It was on 31 st  December, World Health Organization’s
                                  (WHO) Country Office in the People’s Republic of China
                                  picked up a media statement by the Wuhan Municipal Health
                                  Commission from their website on cases of ‘viral pneumonia’
                                  in Wuhan, People’s Republic of China (WHO, 2020). On 11
                                  March 2020, deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of
                                  spread and severity, WHO made the assessment that COVID-
                                  19 can be characterized as a pandemic.
                                    The last pandemic that hit the world severely was the
                                  Spanish Flu that spread worldwide during 1918-1919. It was
                                  caused by an H1N1 virus with genes of avian origin. After a
                                  whole century the world again faced such a severe pandemic
                                  named COVID-19 pandemic. Globally, as of 5:22pm CEST, 20
                                  August 2021, there have been 209,876,613 confirmed cases of

                                  COVID-19, including 4,400,284 deaths, reported to WHO. In
                                  the initial stage, the high infection rate and the severe respiratory
                                  stress created a panic among people. Even, the scientists and
                                  doctors were baffled with the situation. It was quite obscure
                                  about how to fight with the new enemy virus. It was only found
                                  that it was a type of viral infection that spread through droplet
                                  from an infected person. Later, WHO gave a guideline to
                                  follow when somebody does not know who is infected.
                                  According to WHO, people have to stay safe by taking some
                                  simple precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a
                                  mask, especially when distancing cannot be maintained, keeping
                                  rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds and close contact,
                                  regularly cleaning your hands, and coughing into a bent elbow
                                  or tissue.

                                    In line with WHO (2020) recommendations, for the
                                  prevention of COVID-19, International Labour Organization
                                  (ILO) (2020) also suggests that individuals should carry out
                                  physical distancing, maintain good hygiene practices, regularly
                                  clean surfaces, use personal protective equipment (PPE) among
                                  others. As a precaution to slow down its spread, countries all
                                  around the world followed strict protocols such as complete or
                                  partial lockdowns, social distancing regulations, and curfews.
                                  To reduce the chances of humans infecting each other with
                                  Covid-19, places where humans interact closely were shut
                                  down, including educational institutions.
                                    India went for a complete lockdown from 23  March 2020.
                                                                           rd
                                  The country went through the closure of schools, colleges,
                                  universities and all other educational institutions as well as
                                  offices where a large number of people gather every day. The
                                  local administration along with the help of police took the
                                  control of the whole country. Everything came to a standstill in
                                  the country.

                                    India as well as the world witnessed an alarming situation
                                  created by the pandemic caused by SARS-COV2 virus. The
                                  Wuhan virus created a huge panic among people when World
                                  Health Organization (WHO) declared it pandemic and different
                                  countries went for lockdown.
                                    According to UNESCO facts and figures, before the
                                  coronavirus crisis, projections showed that more than 200
                                  million children would be out of school, and only 60 per cent
                                  of young people would be completing upper secondary education
                                  in 2030. Before the coronavirus crisis, the proportion of
                                  children and youth out of primary and secondary school had
                                  declined from 26 per cent in 2000 to 19 per cent in 2010 and
                                  17 per cent in 2018.
                                    In 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the
                                  globe, a majority of countries announced the temporary closure
                                  of schools, impacting more than 91 per cent of students
                                  worldwide. By April 2020, close to 1.6 billion children and
                                  youth were out of school. And nearly 369 million children who

                                    Never before so many children were out of school at the
                                  same time, disrupting learning and upending lives, especially
                                  the most vulnerable and marginalized. The global pandemic has
                                  far-reaching consequences that may jeopardize hard won gains
                                  made in improving global education.

                                    To protect the well-being of children and ensure they have
                                  access to continued learning, UNESCO in March 2020 launched
                                  the COVID-19 Global Education Coalition, a multi-sector
                                  partnership between the UN family, civil society organizations,
                                  media and IT partners to design and deploy innovative solutions.
                                  Together they help countries tackle content and connectivity
                                  gaps, and facilitate inclusive learning opportunities for children

                                  (2019) also defined ICT as the technology that supports activities
                                  involving the creation, storage, manipulation and communication
                                  of information, together with the related methods, management
                                  and application. This means that ICT contributes in making it
                                  realistic for the recording, storing, processing, retrieving and
                                  transmitting of information using technological facilities (Dambo
                                  & Wokocha, 2020).
                                    The advancement of Information Technology has allowed
                                  many countries in the world to move forward and create a
                                  competitive advantage for their nations in the 21st century. The
                                  implementation of ICT in education is considered the most
                                  critical role in creating a competitive society, ready to face
                                  competition and support economic development. Some studies
                                  also find evidence of the benefits of implementing ICT in
                                  education, particularly in helping teaching-learning, thereby
                                  preparing pupils with 21st-century skills and lifelong learning
                                  abilities (Hermawan, 2018). ICT in education has multiplier

                                  providing students with new set of skills; by reaching students
                                  with poor or no access (especially those in rural and remote
                                  regions); by facilitating and improving the training of teachers;
                                  and by minimizing costs associated with traditional instruction
                                  (UNESCO,2014).

                                    Gaps exist in technical skills such as STEM (science,
                                  technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects as well as
                                  soft skills such as communication, teamwork and punctuality
                                  (Puncreobutr, 2016). Gaps exist in technical skills such as

                                  temporarily closed to prevent the spread of the virus, thereby
                                  leading to the use of digital-based learning technology. Students
                                  and educators are encouraged to be active in distance learning
                                  method (Dwidienawati et al., 2020) or online-based information
                                  media to carry out learning activities from the comfort of their
                                  homes. The tools used by faculty during lockdown for teaching
                                  and learning through online modes are Zoom, Google Hangouts,
                                  Skype meet up, Google classrooms, LMS, ICT, YouTube, etc.
                                  Many institutions conducted Faculty development programs
                                  online to gear up the positivity among faculty during the crisis
                                  (Shenoy et al, 2020).
                                    In this global pandemic situation, most of the educational
                                  institutions all around the globe have switched over to digital
                                  mode of operation that is remote based learning approach. In
                                  conventional system of education, students have faced lot of
                                  pressures in listening to the normal mode of class room
                                  teaching during direct interaction, but online or remote based
                                  education learning has given some pace and flexibility to
                                  visualize the concepts as well as process much better than
                                  normal black board teaching style.  Through digital mode, we
                                  can able to improve much better in presenting the concepts
                                  through video simulation in lesser time span, where as in old
                                  or traditional method of education, teacher has to put more
                                  effort in teaching the concepts to students. But today’s students
                                  are tangentially less-attentive in nature. They can be able to see
                                  visually through graphics only, because that kind of education
                                  is preferred by students (P & Karthikeyan, 2021).

                                  Distancing
                                    The switch to online and digital education formats and the
                                  rise of ‘remote’ forms of teaching and learning developed
                                  largely as a consequence of mass closures of schools, colleges
                                  and universities. In this moment of pandemic politics, where
                                  contests are being fought at multiple scales and levels over the
                                  ways to handle and resolve the crisis, distance education has
                                  become a widespread matter of concern for political authorities,
                                  education businesses, charities, teachers, parents and students
                                  alike. Education has become an emergency matter, and along
                                  with it, educational technologies have been positioned as a
                                  frontline emergency service (Williamson et al. 2020).
                                    The impact of the Coronavirus pandemic from early 2020
                                  was felt around the world, with educational institutions having
                                  to abruptly make the switch to emergency remote education
                                  (ERE); some with days of warning, and some with only a
                                  matter of hours (Bozkurt & Sharma, 2020b; Hodges et al.,
                                  2020). Faced with an unprecedented situation for many, teachers
                                  and schools sought to ensure that their students could continue
                                  learning at home, with a range of solutions implemented,

                                  including issuing printed materials, providing access to
                                  educational apps and websites, and employing new learning
                                  management systems, or reviving old ones (Bozkurt et al.,
                                  2020). However, despite widespread hopes that the pandemic
                                  would soon come to an end, ceasing extended periods of
                                  lockdown and the need for emergency remote teaching, second
                                  waves and mutations of the virus now mean that interruptions
                                  to ‘normal’ schooling could continue well into 2021 (e.g.,
                                  Coughlan, 2020b), causing schools and teachers further stress
                                  (Kim & Asbury, 2020).

                                    In such a critical time, there has been a drastic change in
                                  how teaching and learning happen while learners are physically
                                  out of schools and separated from their teachers and co-
                                  learners. The educational practices during the Covid-19
                                  pandemic are denoted with different terms in different countries
                                  (e.g., distance education, e-learning, online education,
                                  homeschooling, etc.). However, these terms do not quite capture
                                  what is being practiced during the interruption of education,
                                  which can better be described as emergency remote education
                                  (ERE).  Considering that the terms used in different countries
                                  are derivations of distance education, as a generic term, the
                                  remarkable difference between emergency remote education
                                  and distance education is that the latter is an option while the
                                  former is an obligation. Such an understanding is crucial
                                  because misconceptions in definitions would lead us to
                                  misconceptions in practices. Distance education, for instance,
                                  is a planned activity and its implementation is grounded in
                                  theoretical and practical knowledge which is specific to the
                                  field and its nature. On the other hand, emergency remote
                                  education is about surviving in a time of crisis with all
                                  resources available, including offline and/or online.
                                    Practitioners and researchers around the world have been
                                  trying to understand how ERE has been implemented, seeking
                                  to identify ways of effectively engaging students in learning
                                  whilst at home during this incredibly difficult time. It is crucial

                                  to explore how home learning is implemented by all stakeholders
                                  (teachers, school leaders, and parents) (Andrew et al., 2020),
                                  given the array of influences on student engagement within
                                  their learning environment (Bond & Bedenlier, 2019).
                                    The systematic review of research on the flipped learning
                                  approach and student engagement by Bond (2020b), included
                                  107 studies, predominantly undertaken within North American
                                  and Asian high schools, and heavily focused on STEM subjects.
                                  The review found that collaborative technologies, such as
                                  Google Docs, and platforms such as Google Classroom and
                                  Edmodo, were particularly linked to engagement, with videos
                                  not created by teachers were more likely to lead to
                                  disengagement. The lure of videos on YouTube, social media
                                  and other non-school related uses of educational technology
                                  has also been found to impact student learning performance
                                  and engagement negatively, especially for students already
                                  prone to disengagement (Bergdahl et al., 2020).
                                    There has been broad discussion on what to call teaching
                                  and learning during the pandemic (and especially lockdown)
                                  times (see e.g., Barbour et al., 2020), with ‘emergency remote
                                  teaching’ seeming to be favoured in higher education (Bozkurt
                                  & Sharma, 2020b; Hodges et al., 2020), alongside other terms
                                  such as ‘remote learning’ (e.g., Daniel, 2020), ‘hybrid learning’
                                  (Blume, 2020) and ‘digital teaching and learning’ (e.g.,
                                  Association for Learning Technology, 2020a). Ewing and Vu
                                  (2020) reported public outcry on Twitter at the use of the term
                                  ‘home schooling’ and, although some parents saw themselves
                                  as merely facilitators of learning, resources about distance and
                                  online teaching and learning were widely sought after by
                                  teachers and parents alike (Cavanaugh & Deweese, 2020).

                                    Psychological Problems of the Stake Holders of Education

                                  sweeping around the world, the future appears more uncertain
                                  than ever. Global infection and illness, population lockdowns,
                                  and mass closures of educational institutions have engulfed
                                  countries across the planet in the short time.
                                    In addition to the profound and global impact of the
                                  pandemic on our social, economic, and political lives, Covid-
                                  19 has also affected individuals both emotionally and
                                  psychologically (Miller, 2020). Due to the pandemic, learners,
                                  teachers and parents are going through a great deal of anxiety.
                                  In their everyday lives, they may be finding self-isolation and
                                  lockdown days difficult or may be concerned about the inability
                                  to self-isolate. They may be worried about the lack of water
                                  and sanitation in their homes and their communities. They may
                                  lack proper nutrition. They may have increased family or
                                  financial responsibilities. They are likely to be distressed about
                                  the health and safety of their loved ones and themselves.

                                    Lack of communication and inconsistent information from
                                  educational institutions and ministries of education have added
                                  to the anxiety. Regarding continuity of teaching and learning,
                                  learners have suddenly needed to direct and regulate their own
                                  learning and become digitally savvy; educators have had to
                                  switch to online teaching overnight regardless of their comfort
                                  level, familiarity, and training in digital pedagogies, and parents
                                  have had to morph into dual roles as parent-educators. This has
                                  put a lot of psychological pressure on all parties, as the shift to
                                  the online medium requires a specific set of technical and
                                  pedagogical knowledge and skills. The steep learning curve and
                                  an overload of information, especially for those who are not
                                  familiar or experienced in online learning and teaching, could
                                  have negative impacts on learners as they may feel unmotivated
                                  and discouraged (Liyanagunawardena, Williams, & Adams,
                                  2013).

                                    Individuals build up their professions, develop abilities,
                                  meet individuals, and sustain connections. The change can be
                                  seen wherever particularly in our wellbeing and prompting an

                                  of innovation, yet in some cases it is dreaded whether this
                                  incorporation of innovation in human lives could decrease a
                                  portion of our fundamental human limits, for example, sympathy
                                  and collaboration. Individuals regularly get more associated
                                  with a virtual world than that of the real world. One of the
                                  other most noteworthy difficulties given by new innovations is
                                  protection or individual security. Individuals intuitively
                                  comprehend why it is so fundamental, yet the following and

                                  (Kumar et al, 2020).
                                    Discussions are there on crucial issues, for example, the

                                  information will just increase in the years ahead. Additionally,

                                  Disorder

                                  incorporate the use of the internet. The increasing use of and
                                  dependence on the internet brought to the surface a new public
                                  health concern near the start of the century “Internet Addiction

                                  for further study. On the heels of this, the close association
                                  between the internet and the smartphone led to the introduction
                                  of a new condition called “Smartphone Addiction”, and has
                                  become a more serious problem. Reported in other terms like

                                  this is a behavioural addiction characterized by the presence of
                                  symptoms of tolerance, salience, mood changes, and dependence
                                  on smartphones (Tajane et al. 2020).Smartphone abuse is
                                  increasing in the 21st century as more and more people enjoy
                                  exploring smartphones in their free hours. Researchers have
                                  evaluated individuals’ subjective smartphone usage and reported
                                  prevalence of smartphone addiction ranging from 8.7% in
                                  Korea to 32% in India. As per a recent survey by smartphone
                                  brand Vivo, in association with Cybermedia Research (CMR),
                                  an average Indian is spending one-third of his or her waking
                                  hours on the phone and the dependency over smartphones has
                                  increased. All forms of screens are most frequently used by
                                  younger age brackets, particularly college students. In the
                                  academic realm, smartphone abuse to addiction is becoming a
                                  rapidly emerging issue because most students whether higher
                                  learning students or low-level students are addicted to
                                  applications found on smartphones.

                                    Smartphone addiction is a global public health concern and
                                  has been extensively researched in the adolescent population.
                                  Similar to other addictions (substance and behavioural),
                                  excessive and addictive smartphone use has been linked to life
                                  stress, lower self-efficacy, higher perceived stress, high internal
                                  locus of control, materialism, and internet addiction. It has
                                  been shown that young people who use cell phones excessively
                                  (for both speaking and text messaging) have increased
                                  restlessness, more careless lifestyles, greater consumption of
                                  stimulating beverages and greater susceptibility to stress [26].
                                  The study of 200 adolescents in Korea also showed that
                                  abnormal users of smartphones had significantly more
                                  problematic behaviours, somatic symptoms, attention deficits,
                                  and aggression. The pattern of use with a cellular phone
                                  includes risky behaviour such as its use while driving, on silent
                                  mode, in closed spaces and while charging.

                                    In the Fourth Industrial Revolution announced by the World
                                  Economic Forum (2016a), a significant transition in the future
                                  of work is foretold. The new-age technologies driven by
                                  Industry 4.0 (I 4.0) have fuelled the ambience of uncertainty
                                  and volatility in our lives and future of jobs. Industry 4.0 is an
                                  amalgamation of cyber-physical systems (CPS), Internet of
                                  Things (IoT) and data, which interconnects society. With the
                                  emergence of technological disruptions, the world is altogether
                                  a new place affecting the entire business market and, eventually,
                                  jobs (Martinaitis, 2014). The latest trends in the job market are
                                  affected by artificial intelligence (AI), robotics and automation
                                  (Future of Jobs, 2019). As per the World Economic Forum
                                  (2016b), the technology disruption might affect around 1.2
                                  billion employees mainly spread over four countries—China,
                                  India, Japan and the United States. But on the other hand,
                                  approximately 133 million new jobs will be created by new-age
                                  organizations to bring about a trade-off between technology
                                  and human capital. However, the new-age jobs would require
                                  next-level skill sets. Thus, there is the utmost need to understand
                                  and absorb the potential of the changing paradigm in the global
                                  workforce environment (Burner, 2018).

                                  which is shocking for job seekers and educators. If not

                                  skills such as STEM (science, technology, engineering and
                                  mathematics) subjects as well as soft skills such as
                                  communication, teamwork and punctuality (Puncreobutr, 2016).

                                  some of the important keywords in the field of psychology due
                                  to the sudden outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. The whole
                                  world as well as the whole education world faced the storm.
                                  The little children and the school children were worst hit by the
                                  pandemic. But, the advancement of technology in the 21 st
                                  century came to rescue the students of all age-groups from this
                                  miserable condition. Everything apparently seemed to be all
                                  right with the use of blended learning, flipped learning, remote
                                  learning, and distance learning. The learners got their classroom
                                  again. This time it was a virtual one. The internet phenomenon
                                  helped to carry out the learning in a virtual environment. In
                                  present day situation this phenomenon has given rise to two
                                  new aspects. Firstly, we are heading towards a virtual society.
                                  The social media is also contributing to the creation of this
                                  virtual society. As a result, people as well as learners are losing
                                  their social skills to interact in a real-life situation. Secondly

                                  Abstract
                                  Online Learning mainly depends on Internet system. According
                                  to government order educational institutions were closed due to
                                  Covid-19 situation. However, education or learning could not
                                  be halted due to the availability of online method. MHRD or
                                  Ministry of Human Resource launched many new initiatives on
                                  education through ICT like e-Pathshala, Diksha Portal, NROER
                                  to promote the online learning. Before the Covid-19 situation
                                  online learning methods were not so common but since the
                                  pandemic time online learning was the main method to help the
                                  nation move forward with technology-enabled learning.
                                  Synchronous and Asynchronous, Linear Learning and
                                  Collaborative Learning are main types of educational technology.

                                  Edmodo, Educlipper, CK-12, Storybird, E-mail are some online
                                  learning tools. There are both advantages and disadvantages of
                                  online learning.

                                  in the year 2019. That spread very quickly all over the world.
                                  Under the alarming circumstances, educational institutions were
                                  closed to prevent the surge of Covid-19 infection. But education

                                  put on hold. Under duress over 1.2 billion children had to bank
                                  upon online method for curriculum transaction. So, educational
                                  system converted from traditional classroom education to online
                                  education. Before the Covid-19 situation online learning methods
                                  were not common for the vast majority of students. During the
                                  pandemic time, however, online learning is being employed for
                                  both real-time (synchronous) and anytime anywhere
                                  (asynchronous) format of interaction to continue education.

                                          to face network problem.
                                      VI. The online learning devices are not easy to access for
                                          needy students.
                                      VII. Instructor may not always be available.
                                    Online Learning and its Challenges in Rural Areas

                                    To attend the online education system we need a good
                                  network facility, electronic device, electricity supply but those
                                  are not always available in rural areas. Now the reach of ICT
                                  has extended to the rural areas but the scenario is not same in
                                  all rural areas. Many rural people in India do face challenges
                                  for online learning. There are many challenges of online
                                  learning:
                                       I. Limited Technological Devices- The economic
                                         condition of rural people is not so good, and this lack
                                         of pecuniary resources may create constraint to procure
                                         a good device required for joining the online classes.
                                         Besides, internet data connection is is also costly. For
                                         some courses project work is usually done by a
                                         computer or laptop but in the rural areas electricity
                                         connection is also not always available.

                                      II. Unknown Technologic Knowledge- Students of rural
                                         area are not as smart as urban students because most
                                         of them are not equipped with proper computer training
                                         and their family members are not used to those types
                                         of technological devices.
                                     III. Weak Internet- That is the biggest problem of e-
                                         learning. The Internet speed is poor in some rural areas
                                         but a good speed internet connection is a prerequisite
                                         for attending smooth online class.
                                     IV. In the remote areas people face extreme climate problem
                                         like flood, cyclone, topographical problem etc.


                                                                                     247]]></page><page Index="249"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                    Future of Online Learning

                                    E-learning was not as popular as it became during Covid-19
                                  pandemic situation. During Covid-19 pandemic condition
                                  education methods changed remarkably. Now online learning
                                  method is more preferred. According to the National Center for
                                  Education Statistics between 2002 and 2005, 65% more K-12
                                  students were enrolled in online courses that shot up to 66% in
                                  the last decade and 86.5% of all US based higher education
                                  institutions. Most of the educational institutions now utilise
                                  online learning methods. So, online learning will grow more
                                  rapidly in future.
                                    Conclusion
                                    Over the last few years the use of technology in educational
                                  sector has increased. But in Covid-19 pandemic time educational
                                  institutions had to be closed temporarily. In the tribal areas
                                  students were not able to join virtual classes for many reasons.
                                  It was not only problem for the students of indigenous
                                  communities residing in tribal areas but also for other students
                                  of rural backwater at large. Government and many non-
                                  governmental organizations took initiatives to solve their
                                  problem. However, it is an issue of application of technology
                                  in educational sector when Internet connectivity is poor and
                                  many students of rural hamlets found it difficult to afford costly
                                  gadgets. It was true that government came up with many online
                                  platforms to help the learners during the Covid-19 pandemic
                                  time. By it is important to realise the foundational issue that if
                                  we fail to apply advance technology in education then the
                                  question of attending the online classes does not arise. Everything
                                  entails both positive as well as negative result, so is the case
                                  with online learning. It makes education globally, eco-friendly
                                  and flexible. Based on the above discussion we can deduce that
                                  e- learning is a necessary thing in our present educational life.

                                  Abstract
                                  The scenario of education has changed with the development of
                                  E-learning technologies and governmental initiatives worldwide.
                                  There is no longer a physical classroom during covid-19
                                  situation, and e-learning works as a panacea in this global
                                  crisis.  Now in every sector, work is going on remotely through
                                  various digital platforms, especially in educational  sector as all
                                  schools, colleges and universities are about to resume yet with
                                  strict adherence to health protocols and advisories to check the
                                  spread of Covid virus. Before Covid-19, online learning was
                                  mainly used for distance or correspondence courses and in
                                  regular classes teachers used it as supplementary inputs. But in
                                  the present situation we cannot even think of education without
                                  online and internet support. From time to time the government
                                  has developed initiatives and a portal to promote and maintain
                                  the quality of online education that will be easy to access and
                                  free in nature. The purpose of this paper is to explore the online
                                  initiatives developed by the government of India mainly for
                                  higher learning.

                                    Background of the study:

                                    With  the  beginning  of the 21st  century,  a  massive
                                  transition has occurred  in  the  world  of  education.  Those
                                  days  are  gone  when  teaching  was  limited  only  within  the
                                  four  boundaries  of  a  classroom.  The  internet  has  brought
                                  about  a  drastic  change  in  the  fundamental  way  in  which
                                  learning  is  done.  It has taken learning beyond the hallowed
                                  walls of the universities and into the palms of everyone. But
                                  the question occurs, how did this radical transformation occur?
                                  (Soumik Sarkar et al 2020). Evolution of online learning has its
                                  own great history; initially there was a concept of using
                                  technologies in the teaching -learning process but as a
                                  supplementary tool which worked only as a helper. In 1989, the
                                  University of Phoenix became the first educational institution
                                  to offer a fully online collegiate course in both Bachelor’s and
                                  Master’s degree. This was the beginning of great evolution
                                  which has changed the scenario of all the sectors of human life
                                  specially education.

                                    Now, what is online learning? The learning that takes place
                                  through World Wide Web, email, chat, new groups and texts,
                                  audio and video conferencing and delivered over computer
                                  networks to impart education is regarded as online learning. It
                                  is often referred to as “e-Learning” among other terms. Online
                                  learning can be termed as a tool that can make the teaching–
                                  learning process more student-centered, more innovative, and
                                  even more flexible. Online learning is defined as “learning
                                  experiences in synchronous or asynchronous environments
                                  using different devices (e.g., mobile phones, laptops, etc.) with
                                  internet access (Shivangi Dhawan et al 2020). However, online
                                  learning is just one type of “distance learning” - the umbrella
                                  term for any learning that takes place across distance and not
                                  in a traditional classroom. “Most of the terms (online learning,

                                                                                     253]]></page><page Index="255"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  open learning, web-based learning, computer-mediated learning,
                                  blended learning, m-learning, for ex.) have in common the
                                  ability to use a computer connected to a network, that offers the
                                  possibility to learn from anywhere, anytime, in any rhythm,
                                  with any means’’  (Cojocariu et al., 2014).The limitations of
                                  traditional learning method have encouraged the development
                                  of online learning in the educational process. Traditional learning
                                  method focuses primarily on the classroom education which is
                                  very much restricted to a predetermined time limit and a
                                  specific location where the students are needed to be present
                                  and attend the lecture (Amritpal Singh, 2019). India has one of
                                  the largest higher education systems in the world with over
                                  1,000 universities and 50,000 colleges and institutions and the
                                  demand for this is continuously increasing because of the job
                                  scarcity and middle-class high ambition (Prashant K.
                                  Nanda,2021). The students who wanted to carry on their higher
                                  education along with their earning means it was not possible
                                  for them to do so along with this, education was not accessible
                                  for maximum population with minimum cost hance, the need to
                                  encourage the online learning system was prioritized. Previously,
                                  online learning was primarily meant for higher learning but
                                  gradually with its successful implication and high demand it
                                  started involving the secondary level of education and now in
                                  the time of covid-19 pandemic lockdown (restricting human
                                  contact to stop spreading infection) when all the educational
                                  institutions were shut from nearly more than 1 1/2  years,  the
                                  online learning was only means of education for all level of
                                  education system starting from class 1 to Post-graduation level.
                                  We all know the fact that old is gold and to some extent online
                                  learning has some negative impact on human development
                                  process such as poor communication skill, sense of isolation,
                                  frustration, stress, in some cases, poor performance in learning
                                  and teaching, although with time and situation everything has
                                  to change. Only then a balance can be maintained in life.

                                    In this time of lockdown everything has shifted from face-
                                  to-face mode to online version specially education sector.
                                  Educational system moves forward towards e-learning and
                                  teaching is undertaken remotely and through various digital
                                  platforms. These online learning platforms are providing free
                                  access to their educational service despite being private or
                                  public, even in some places many digital platforms have been
                                  developed to reduce the impact of lockdown and provide high
                                  quality learning experience. Some media channels like BBC are
                                  also providing virtual learning opportunities for students. So,
                                  the purpose of this paper is to explore the available digital
                                  platform for online learning with great emphasis on higher
                                  education learning.
                                    Online learning:
                                    “Online” means being “connected to a computer” and
                                  ‘learning’  means “acquiring knowledge or experience”. Any
                                  computer or electronic device can only connect to another with
                                  the help of the internet. So, we can say that online learning is
                                  a type of learning in which learning takes place by connecting
                                  to another computer which has an internet facility. Computer-
                                  based training, Web-based training, Internet based training,
                                  online training, e-learning (electronic learning), m-learning
                                  (mobile learning), computer-aided distance education - online
                                  education goes by many names and comes in a variety of styles,
                                  but at its core: “Online education is electronically supported
                                  learning that relies on the Internet for teacher/student interaction
                                  and the distribution of class materials.” (India education).
                                  Online learning basically works on the principle of 3A-
                                  Accessibility, Availability and Affordability of learning material
                                  to a larger population, within given time and minimum resources.

                                  requirement is access to a computer, Internet, and the stronger

                                  the help of electronic media such as microphone, listening
                                  device or audio and video-tapes can be termed e- learning. In
                                  general e-learning refers to all types of learning which is
                                  facilitated and supported by ICT (information and
                                  communication Technologies) and means like CD-ROMs and
                                  DVDs, teleconferencing, video-conferencing, E-mail, live chat,
                                  etc (Mangal & mangal, 2014).
                                    Virtual -Classroom-Virtual classroom as the name suggests
                                  is classroom like environment in virtual reality. In simple terms
                                  Murray (2007) defines a virtual classroom as a web-based
                                  environment that allows you to participate in live training
                                  events without the need to travel. We can listen, participate in
                                  lab exercises, ask questions and receive feedback by simply
                                  sitting in front of a desktop with an internet connection.
                                    Web-based Learning-We can say Web-based learning as an
                                  online learning or e-learning because here course content is
                                  available online. Learning can take place through Discussion
                                  forums via email, videoconferencing, and live lectures (video
                                  streaming). One important aspect of using web-based learning
                                  is that they contain hyperlinks; by clicking on that link another
                                  web page can be opened. Thus, students can get access to vast
                                  amounts of web-based information.
                                    M-Learning- M-learning is also known as mobile learning.
                                  It is a new way of accessing the learning content by using a
                                  modern mobile device connected to the Internet. By using this
                                  device, learners can learn anywhere, anytime, whenever they
                                  want. Mobile devices can be used for a blended learning
                                  approach. Some advantages of mobile learning are-  we can
                                  learn wherever and whenever we want, we remain more
                                  motivated on mobile learning, we can get real time feedback
                                  from our teams or classmates, it reduces the issue of long-
                                  distance form study.

                                    Synchronous Online learning-In synchronous learning all
                                  participants are required to be together online at the same time
                                  even though they are in different locations. In this type of
                                  learning students are given content with assignments along with
                                  a time frame to complete the assignment. Synchronous
                                  classrooms use web and videoconferencing technologies— like
                                  Google Meet, Google Hangouts, or Zoom for learning.
                                    Asynchronous online Learning-In Asynchronous learning
                                  all participants in the learning process can attain learning at
                                  different times and at different places. It offers flexibility to
                                  learners in order to study in a self-paced manner. In asynchronous
                                  learning there is also a deadline of assignment submission, but
                                  students can connect with materials, peers, and instructors on
                                  their own schedules. Teachers post video or audio, record
                                  lectures online and then post quizzes on the material so that the
                                  student can watch or listen to it.
                                    Fixed E-Learning-In Fixed E-learning the same content is
                                  not fixed for all students in the class, as happened in the
                                  traditional learning; rather in fixed e-learning after analyzing
                                  each student individually through their data, changes are made
                                  in the study materials that lead to better learning outcomes for
                                  all students.
                                    Online support learning -It is a form of E-learning and
                                  relatively more interactive.  In online support students interact
                                  with their teachers and classmates in the form of chat rooms,
                                  e-mail, forums, online bulletin boards, or instant messaging.
                                  Here students get opportunities to be more interactive than
                                  knowledge databases, online support gives them opportunity
                                  for more precise queries, as well as for more immediate responses.
                                    Simulation -It is extremely interactive and depends mainly
                                  upon video, graphics, audio and a certain amount of gamification.
                                  Here traditional recreations are used to aid in learning, including
                                  3D mechanisms. Here students get the opportunity to practise
                                  the procedure or routine before actual implementation.

                                  crore people with the help of National Mission in Education
                                  through Information and Communication Technology.
                                    Conclusion: Online Education has brought a positive impact
                                  in the lives of students during covid-19 when the central
                                  government and different state governments of different regions
                                  promoted the use of ICT in the field of education, especially
                                  during the lockdown period in order to make education reachable
                                  to the student at remote areas. The government publicized the
                                  existing E-learning projects like SWAYAM, NMEICT, SWAYAM
                                  PRABHA, etc. and also launched new tools for encouraging E-
                                  learning. It offered the students an opportunity to take up
                                  additional courses along with their studies or jobs as per their
                                  convenience. Online education not only benefits students but
                                  educators also as it turns to become an increasingly popular
                                  learning approach due to the growth of internet technologies.
                                  Hence now both students and teachers can access and store a
                                  wide range of material online according to their convenience.
                                  But we cannot ignore the hardship of those indigent students
                                  who do not have any access to online technologies mainly due
                                  to financial constraints in buying the costly digital devices and
                                  internet package. This digital divide increases the gaps of
                                  inequality in education during this pandemic. It is really very
                                  commendable that the government is launching various initiatives
                                  for students and teachers as well for maintaining the quality of
                                  education at all levels, but still some areas are there which
                                  needs substantial improvement.

                                  Abstract
                                  Education renders a significant contribution in leading the
                                  progress to effective growth and development of individuals.
                                  Teachers have an important duty and role to play in imparting
                                  education to students. The major significance of present scenario
                                  of teacher education is to focus upon the training to the
                                  teachers in sync with the line of techno-pedagogical skills in
                                  achieving the desired academic outcomes. Teachers have an
                                  important role to play during pandemic time for teaching as
                                  well as effective way to assess student’s performance and
                                  development of the faculty of their students. In spite of the
                                  provisions for online learning there are certain barriers in
                                  performing their job and duties up to the required standard.
                                  Hence it is vital for them to enhance their skills and abilities.
                                  The NEP-2020 also speaks of improving teacher education in
                                  various aspects. The main areas that have been taken into
                                  account in this paper are objectives, scope of teacher education,
                                  changing context of teacher education in the Indian scenario,
                                  and challenges before teacher education during pandemic.

                                    Introduction
                                    An educational institution performs a significant function of
                                  providing learning experiences to lead their students from the
                                  darkness of ignorance to the light of knowledge. The key
                                  personnel in the institutions who play an important role to bring
                                  about this transformation are teachers. As stated by NCTE
                                  (1998) in Quality Concerns in Secondary Teacher Education,
                                  ¯The teacher is the most important element in any educational
                                  program. It is  the teacher who is mainly responsible for
                                  implementation of the educational process at any stage. This
                                  shows that it is imperative to invest in the preparation of
                                  teachers, so that the future of a nation is secure. The importance
                                  of competent teachers to the nation’s school system can in no
                                  way be overemphasized. The National Curriculum Framework
                                  2005 places demands and expectations on the teacher, which
                                  needs to be addressed by both initial and continuing teacher
                                  education.

                                  theory + Professional skills.
                                    Teaching skills include providing training and practice in
                                  the different techniques, approaches and strategies that would
                                  help the teachers to plan and impart instruction, provide
                                  appropriate reinforcement and conduct effective assessment. It
                                  includes effective classroom management skills, preparation
                                  and use of instructional materials and communication skills.
                                    Pedagogical theory includes the philosophical, sociological
                                  and psychological considerations that would enable the teachers
                                  to have a sound basis for practicing the teaching skills in the
                                  classroom. The theory is stage specific and is based on the
                                  needs and requirements that are characteristic of that stage.
                                    Professional skills encompass the techniques, strategies

                                    Techno-Pedagogy: Literally, ‘pedagogy’  refers to the art
                                  &science of teaching. The word Techno is derived from the
                                  Latin word ‘texere’ which means to weave or fabricate.
                                  Combination of both the words ‘techno pedagogy’ means
                                  weaving the technology into the teaching learning process.

                                  defined as the ability to use ICT in a pedagogical context. It

                                  instructional strategy and evaluation through ICT.
                                    Significance of Teacher  Education
                                    1) It is our common knowledge that the academic and
                                  professional standards of teachers constitute a critical component
                                  of the essential learning conditions for achieving the educational
                                  goals of a nation. The aspects that need greater emphasis are:

                                                                                     275]]></page><page Index="277"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                    l The length of academic preparation.

                                    l The level and quality of subject matter knowledge.
                                    l The repertoire of pedagogical skills that teachers possess
                                       to meet the needs of diverse learning situations.

                                    l The degree of commitment to the profession.
                                    l Sensitivity to contemporary issues and problems and the
                                       level of motivation.

                                    This is not possible if teacher preparation is focused only on
                                  training. Holistic teacher building is necessary and therefore
                                  teacher education requires more emphasis than mere training.
                                    2) Educating all children in excellent manner depends not
                                  only on ensuring that teachers have the necessary knowledge
                                  and skills to carry out their work, but simultaneously it is
                                  equally important that they take responsibility for seeing that
                                  all children reach high levels of learning and that they act
                                  accordingly.
                                    3) People come to teacher education with beliefs, values,
                                  commitments, personalities and moral codes from their
                                  upbringing and schooling which affect who they are as teachers
                                  and what they are able to learn in teacher education and in
                                  teaching.
                                    4) On a daily basis, teachers confront complex decisions
                                  that rely on many different kinds of knowledge and judgment
                                  and that can involve high stakes outcomes for students future.
                                  To make good decisions, teachers must be aware of the many
                                  ways in which student learning can unfold in the context of
                                  development, learning differences, language and cultural
                                  influences, and individual temperaments, interests and
                                  approaches to learning teachers need to keep what is best for
                                  the student at the centre of their decision making.
                                    5) Teacher education like any other educational intervention,
                                  can only work on those professional commitments or dispositions
                                  that are susceptible to modification.

                                  of China and then it started to spread rapidly all over the world
                                  since January 2020. People had to maintain social distancing
                                  norms. People avoided touching others and maintaining social
                                  distancing. During that crucial period teachers came forward to

                                  of ICT and more emphasis on innovative practices are need of
                                  the hour. Thus, teacher education programme has to be revisited,
                                  reformed, and reoriented today. There are following major
                                  challenges prevailing in the teacher education system.
                                    Infrastructure
                                    It has been found that a lot of teacher education institutions
                                  do not have their own infrastructure; they are being run in
                                  rented buildings, lacks of basic equipment, technological support,
                                  adequate books, halls, library. But the changing concept of

                                  teacher education system needs more technological support,
                                  adequate equipments, e-printed materials, e-books-content. In
                                  the present scenario, the lack of infrastructure in the field of
                                  education has emerged as a big challenge.       .
                                    Professional Development of Teachers

                                    The traditional approach to teaching is more prevalent in
                                  schools among older teachers who were taught and have been
                                  teaching in this manner. It gives more emphasis on mastery of
                                  concepts and procedures as the ultimate goal of instruction and
                                  little emphasis on modern approaches. Several institutes and
                                  colleges lack the basic facilities like a library or laboratory and
                                  other equipment for the professional development of teachers.
                                  It is necessarily required for the effectiveness activities should
                                  be spread over time, be collaborative use active learning, be
                                  delivered to groups of teachers include periods of practice,
                                  coaching, and follow-up, promote reflective practice, encourage
                                  experimentation, and respond to teachers’ needs, along with
                                  content and methodology, there is a strong need to integrate
                                  emotional competencies and life skills with individual
                                  development, continuing education, in-service education,
                                  curriculum writing, and peer collaboration.

                                    ICT and E-learning
                                    With the onset and proliferation of Information and
                                  Communication Technology (ICT), there is a growing demand
                                  that it be included in school education. Teacher education has
                                  been structured to orient and sensitize the teacher to distinguish
                                  between developmentally appropriate and detrimental uses of
                                  ICT. Teachers also need competence to use ICT for their own
                                  professional development. There is a need to have trained
                                  teachers to handle the challenges of exclusion prevailing in
                                  changing concept. Some teachers do not have clarity about how
                                  far technology can be beneficial for the facilitation and
                                  enhancement of learning due to lack of competency to handle
                                  it, whereas some teachers may have a positive outlook towards


                                                                                     281]]></page><page Index="283"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  the technology. Teacher resistance and lack of enthusiasm to
                                  use ICT in education may also be another limitation.
                                    Growing Stress among Teachers
                                    Life in pandemic situation has made the teacher’s job
                                  physically and mentally very challenging. The teacher needs a
                                  lot of energy to deal with classroom situations and professional
                                  work. Sometimes, the teacher comes under stress due to a
                                  growing workload. Occupational stress has also affected the
                                  growth of teachers. Occupational stress takes place when there
                                  is a mismatch between the demand of the environment/workplace
                                  and an individual’s ability to carry out a task.  The major
                                  causes for stress among teachers are excessive working hours,
                                  excessive workload, changes in curriculum and courses, rising
                                  class sizes, changes to assessment and testing requirements,
                                  workplace bullying, poor management, risk of violence from
                                  pupils , lack of job security, lack of control over the job, burden
                                  of providing cover and lack of public esteem.
                                    Assessment and Evaluation:

                                     The main challenges identified in remote assessment and
                                  evaluation was academic dishonesty, paucity of infrastructural
                                  facilities, issues related to coverage, questionable learning
                                  outcome, and dilly dally of students to submit assessments. To
                                  minimize academic dishonesty, preparing different questions to
                                  each student was found to be the best approach. Online face to
                                  face presentation was also found to be good option to control
                                  academic integrity violations. Organising seminar, discussion,
                                  oral question-answer were other methods for controlling this
                                  situation.
                                    Related to Quality Concern
                                    Quality teacher education undoubtedly plays a key role in
                                  nation building. A  nation which is incapable of providing
                                  quality teacher education cannot produce competent and skilled
                                  teachers. Competent teachers shape the future of society. The

                                  quality of teacher reflects in his/her mastery over the subject,
                                  professional commitment, pedagogical skill, ICT, good
                                  communications, diagnostic skills, and different learning styles.
                                  Therefore, well trained, efficient and committed teachers are
                                  the greatest assets of any education system and thereby of the
                                  nation. Teachers’  quality is fundamentally connected with the
                                  students’ learning outcomes. In the present scenario, the quality
                                  concern in the field of education has emerged as a big
                                  challenge.
                                    Inclusive Education

                                    ‘Persons with Disabilities’  (PWD) have to face different
                                  kinds of problems every day. The societal attitude toward their
                                  problems makes it more difficult for them. The availability of
                                  resources is so scarce and challenges are so insuperable. There
                                  are many challenges in educating children with disabilities in
                                  regular classrooms during this pandemic period. These challenges
                                  are arising out of scarcity of human and material resources,
                                  negative attitudes of untrained teachers. There is an urgent need
                                  of trained teachers to handle the challenges of exclusion
                                  prevailing in schools; firstly, the exclusion of children with
                                  disabilities and secondly the social exclusion of children who
                                  come from socially and economically deprived section of
                                  society.

                                       These triangulated areas then constitute TPACK, which
                                       considers the relationships among all three areas and

                                       complex space.
                                    l The prospective teachers should be trained with the
                                       skills which are necessary to deal with the ‘Children
                                       with Special Needs’ along with the normal students in
                                       the inclusive classrooms. Inclusive education should be
                                       made an integral part of the teacher education curriculum.
                                    l Government of India should consider to bring some hike
                                       in the salary of teachers on regular basis.

                                    l Our teachers need to be upgraded with the emerging
                                       developments taking place in the area of education.

                                    Conclusion
                                     The teacher is the central axis of the entire educational
                                  system, hence most crucial for effecting desirable changes in
                                  the teaching-learning process. The whole educational activities
                                  revolve around the teacher. Thus, quality teachers are the key
                                  factors in achieving sustainable global development. Therefore,
                                  their training, recruitment, retention, status and working
                                  conditions should be among global priorities today. But the
                                  shortage of well-trained teachers is a significant problem today.
                                  The restructuring curriculum of teacher education programme
                                  needs to be revised according to the changing needs of the
                                  society.

                                  COVID-19 significantly changes all aspects of human life; the
                                  changes require everyone to change from old habits to new
                                  habits that are not in vogue. Changes in general in face-to-face
                                  classes began to shift to virtual classes. COVID-19 has
                                  pinpointed the problem of school managements and way of
                                  learning between teacher and students. The teaching and learning
                                  process hitherto mediated through face to face mode must be
                                  shifted to an online system. This condition has an impact
                                  directly in the world of education. Educational institutions
                                  concerned with formal, informal and non-formal education
                                  henceforth takes a quantum jump in favour of learning online.
                                  Transition learning from face to face to be online learning
                                  spawns lot of barriers for teachers since the crisis happened
                                  suddenly without prior preparation. The educators have used
                                  online platforms to reach out to students; webinars have
                                  become temporary classrooms, parents have been asked to
                                  monitor home, and students have been deprived of social

                                  interaction between peers. Subjects of the humanities stream
                                  can be taught well through remote learning. However, this is
                                  not the case with subjects like engineering or architecture or
                                  music or arts, where children need to attend lab or practical
                                  classes. So, while children can learn the theoretical aspects of
                                  these subjects through remote learning, they can’t attend the lab
                                  or practical sessions. Internet and web-based educational delivery
                                  system can be synchronous even when teacher and students are
                                  separated physically and geographically. The teacher’s challenges
                                  toward online learning in the pandemic era can be divided into
                                  three categories. They are supporting facilitation, the process of
                                  learning, and the climate of learning activities itself. But the
                                  teachers miss the deeper interactions with their students, so
                                  they cannot control students’  affective factors which are also
                                  important for the teaching and learning process. Although
                                  parents are trying their best to keep their children engaged in
                                  meaningful activities, there are some challenges that they
                                  recognize as well. Parents around the world were rightfully
                                  concerned about how their children’s routines got disrupted
                                  extensively. To combat this issue, they designed homemade
                                  time-tables according to which children should have something
                                  to do at most times and should have a normal sleep-wake cycle.

                                    The teaching and learning process underwent a revolutionary
                                  transformation since the Corona Virus outbreak. Education is
                                  one of the sectors that received a big impact. The announcement
                                  on the global pandemic of the corona virus (COVID-19) took
                                  place on 12 March 2020 and it required policy wonks to
                                  prescube social distancing which kicked off a problem such the
                                  school closing affecting the learning of millions of children and
                                  adolescents. COVID-19 triggered the problem of school
                                  management and way of learning between teacher and students.
                                  The teaching and learning process which followed face to face

                                                                                     287]]></page><page Index="289"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  method had to be changed to an online system. This condition
                                  had an impact directly in the world of education. Educational
                                  institutions concerned with formal, informal and non-formal
                                  education henceforth took a quantum jump in favour of learning
                                  online. Transition learning from face to face to become online
                                  learning spawns lot barriers for teachers since the crisis happened
                                  suddenly without prior preparation. Educators have used online
                                  platforms to reach out to students; webinars have become
                                  temporary classrooms, parents have been asked to monitor
                                  home, and students have been deprived of social interaction
                                  between peers. In face-to-face learning activities learning media
                                  can be people, objects around, environment and everything that
                                  can be used by teachers as an intermediary to convey subject
                                  matter (Rosalina,et.al 2020).
                                    Educating children in the learning process in the Post-
                                  modern era is not only the task of the teacher, but at this time
                                  parents are required to guide and monitor children’s learning at
                                  home. It is not appropriate if the responsibility is only delegated
                                  to the teacher in the teaching and learning process. Parents are
                                  required to play an active role in guiding their children to study
                                  at home. The parents at home must know the child’s homework
                                  assignments. Children’s learning media must also be provided;
                                  parents must provide time to guide their children to study at
                                  home every day. Teachers and parents have an equally important
                                  role and responsibility in education. Parents need to be open to
                                  changes in order to be able to anticipate and respond to the
                                  challenges in the world of education which are mostly done
                                  online so that children can continuously develop themselves in
                                  a relevant way both formally and informally (www.researchgate.
                                  net).
                                    Challenges faced by students:
                                    Children are used to attending school where they learn in
                                  the company of their friends and under the guidance of
                                  teachers. However, switching to remote learning has created
                                  problems for them, some of which are as follows:

                                    l Curriculum: Subjects of the humanities stream can be
                                       taught well through remote learning. However, this is not
                                       the case with subjects like engineering or architecture or
                                       music or arts, where children need to attend lab or
                                       practical classes. So, while children can learn the
                                       theoretical aspects of these subjects through remote
                                       learning, they can’t attend the lab or practical sessions.
                                       However, with schools and colleges closed, there’s not
                                       much that we can do to overcome this problem.

                                    l Loss of attention: A classroom is a place where students
                                       learn under the guidance and monitoring of the teachers.
                                       However, while taking online classes in the comfort of
                                       one’s own home, children miss out on the classroom
                                       experience. This can make them feel distracted or less
                                       attentive. They may log out of the session midway or
                                       engage in other digital activities, such as browsing the
                                       internet or chatting. Because of such distractions, a child
                                       may fail to learn well through remote learning.
                                    l Unhelpful home environment: The home environment
                                       plays an important role in motivating a child to learn.
                                       Happy families where parents show interest in their
                                       child’s studies can help children learn better through
                                       remote learning, whereas unstable families and an
                                       unhappy home environment may adversely affect the
                                       motivation to learn.
                                    l No interaction with friends: Humans are social beings.
                                       Playing, talking and doing activities together are part of
                                       children’s daily lives. But, being forced to stay at home
                                       makes children miss all these activities. Lack of social
                                       interactions can make children, especially teens, feel
                                       bored and distracted from their studies.

                                    l Anxiety about the future: The COVID-19 pandemic has
                                       been in the news for a few months now, and is a part of


                                                                                     289]]></page><page Index="291"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                       most conversations-be it among family members or
                                       friends. Children can feel scared listening to such
                                       conversations. They may fear getting infected or losing
                                       their loved ones to the disease. This can cause immense
                                       emotional distress to children and take their focus away
                                       from their studies (www.parentcircle.com).
                                    Motivation and face to face interaction are very much
                                  required for academic achievement of the school students. But
                                  due to online classes students get less motivation and chances
                                  for face to face contact with the teachers and their peer groups.
                                  In this situation it is the big challenges to the students for their
                                  academic achievement.
                                    Challenges for  Teachers:

                                    In broad sense online learning refers to an education which
                                  is led by teacher by using Internet and web-based educational
                                  delivery system where teacher and students are separated
                                  physically and geographically but by using software they are
                                  joined together in carrying forward learning. Popularly there
                                  are synchronous (participants are involved in real time
                                  communication, for example online mode by using zoom,
                                  Google meet and many others) and asynchronous (participants
                                  involved are not in real time communication, for example
                                  interaction in chat room in social media or learning discussion
                                  forum). Online synchronous instruction in a virtual classroom
                                  is problematic. The truth is that attending the class online at the
                                  same time is becoming harder and harder, let alone being able
                                  to offer structured lectures and encourage learning activities.
                                  Time zones, Internet access and bandwidth, technological
                                  breakdowns, individual student schedules (work vs. study), are
                                  all real problems facing online teachers and learners. Even if an
                                  instructor manages to get all students to come to virtual
                                  classrooms at the same moment, basic things like lack of lip
                                  coordination and verbal clues, time lags, bad sound and pictures
                                  etc., become major bottlenecks (Coverdale-Jones, 2000; Hampel

                                    The teacher’s challenges toward online learning in the
                                  pandemic era are divided into three points of view. They are
                                  supporting facilitation, the process of learning, and the climate
                                  of learning activities itself. The teachers miss the deep
                                  interactions of their students, so they cannot control students’
                                  affective factors which also important for the teaching and
                                  learning process.
                                    Challenges Faced By Teachers in Online Teaching
                                    1. Difficult to reach students in remote areas

                                       It is most problematic for the teacher to reach remote
                                       area students and teach them properly.

                                    2. Difficult to motivate students
                                       Motivated students always give the best through their
                                       performance. They stay loyal and committed to their task
                                       or responsibilities. Without motivation it becomes difficult
                                       for the students to cope up with academics as they lose
                                       their interest and they are unable to perform better in the
                                       examination.
                                    3. Challenges to keep tracking of student’s progress
                                       In online learning environment, it is important to help
                                       students to engage with course material which provides
                                       them ample opportunities of learning. Especially when
                                       students are learning remotely; the teacher must recognize
                                       the importance and problems of the students. Progress of
                                       students can be tracked through student’s attendance,
                                       periodically exam, and mock interview
                                    4. Problem of electricity / Internet connectivity
                                       Without strong access of electricity and internet
                                       connectivity online classes cannot operate smoothly. In
                                       rural area, electricity tends to fluctuate most of the time,
                                       and there is no fixed time of its certain availability. High
                                       internet connectivity, Wi-Fi and broadband connections

                                                                                     291]]></page><page Index="293"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                       that facilitate high-speed internet cannot be installed in
                                       rural area, while some people can’t afford it due to its
                                       high cost.
                                    5. Lack of technical /Software knowledge
                                       Teacher and students should be able to handle computer
                                       and software easily during online classes. Without proper
                                       knowledge of the software they can’t access online
                                       learning or record visual and audio. Software also required
                                       some specific requirement i.e. – space of operating hard
                                       disk, updated windows, latest graphic on computer and
                                       many more. Without proper knowledge, it is quite
                                       harassment to take online classes for both teacher and
                                       students.
                                    6. Required more time in preparing course content
                                       Teaching online courses are not the same as classroom
                                       teaching. The researcher want to know does preparing
                                       course content in online teaching takes more time than
                                       preparation in classroom teaching.
                                    7. Lack of motivation in online learner
                                       Motivation tends to influence interest and changes student
                                       behaviour. Online learning requires more self-attention
                                       than in classroom education. It is important for learners
                                       to be active and interested during online classes to
                                       understand the syllabus or course content.
                                    8. Difficult to teach numerical subject through online
                                       mode
                                       In classroom teaching numerical subjects are taught on a
                                       blackboard/ whiteboard. In blackboard/ whiteboard the
                                       teacher can write their formula and methods to explain
                                       students. Learners also can respond immediately to the
                                       teacher if there are any doubts about formula and
                                       equations.

                                    9. Difficult to monitoring discipline

                                    The goal of teaching is to ensure that each student receives
                                       quality education, skills and develop talent. In classroom
                                       teaching the teacher ensures discipline is maintained
                                       properly, rules are enforced, and students are in a safe
                                       learning environment. But in the case of online classes
                                       teachers cannot exercise physical control on the learners
                                       (Gurung.S 2021).
                                    Challenges for  parents:

                                    Although parents are trying their best to keep their children
                                  engaged in meaningful activities, there are some challenges that
                                  they recognize as well. A  number of children are considering
                                  the pandemic induced closure as a vacation from school; hence
                                  they want nothing to do with a normal school-like routine.
                                  Instead, they want to sleep and wake up according to their own
                                  wish and spend the rest of the time playing video games and
                                  watching cartoon and movies. This is a potential threat to their
                                  social, educational as well as physical development. Their
                                  lifestyle is becoming sedentary with limited outdoor access and
                                  they are not used to physical activities inside their house,
                                  probably because of the lack of space.
                                    It is especially challenging if the parents are also working
                                  from home, and have their own schedules to follow. Obviously
                                  what happens is that children cannot be provided with parental
                                  company or quality time and often parents end up allowing
                                  their children to do things their way (Bhamani, 2020).
                                    Parents around the world are rightfully concerned about
                                  how their children’s routines are disrupted extensively. To
                                  combat this issue, they have designed homemade time-tables
                                  according to which children should have something to do at
                                  most times and should have a normal sleep-wake cycle.
                                  Implementing a schedule helps children feel less restless and
                                  more productive. It can also prevent unnecessary internet and
                                  computer time (Bhamani, 2020).

                                                                                     293]]></page><page Index="295"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                    Parents agree that the lockdown has brought with it seemingly
                                  limitless time and this could be a unique opportunity to try out
                                  new things and ideas. They believe in getting creative with the
                                  kids, which positively affects both the parties and makes the
                                  days look fruitful. From arts and crafts to cooking, from
                                  dancing to singing, parents and their children are open to all
                                  ideas. Some of them have also enrolled their kids in online
                                  courses so that by the end of this period the children can
                                  succeed to acquire some soft-skills and structured knowledge
                                  too (Bhamani, 2020).

                                    Conclusion: During COVID-19 pandemic entire teaching –
                                  learning paradigm shifts towards online mode. It is not new for
                                  the students but under duress the compulsion to adopt ICT
                                  rapidly was unprecedented for both the teacher fraternity and
                                  parents alike. Students and side by side teachers and parents
                                  have confronted several issues while adopting this new technique
                                  of teaching –learning. Motivation and face to face interaction
                                  are very much required for academic achievement of the school
                                  students. But due to online classes students get less motivation
                                  and chances for face to face contact with the teachers and their
                                  peer groups. In this situation it is the big challenge to the
                                  students for their academic achievement. Taking online classes
                                  on regular basis is a challenge for the teachers who are not used
                                  to such method and even to them online learning objective for
                                  teaching is vague. Besides, they find making content for the
                                  instruction in the online classes pretty difficult. Maintaining
                                  time-table, contacting students, delivery of content, continuously
                                  motivating students, evaluation of the performance of the
                                  students, making practical classes—these are the different
                                  challenges faced by teachers during this pandemic situation.
                                  Students are not going to schools, rather they are doing online
                                  classes from their home. Continuous monitoring of child is not
                                  possible for parents at their home because they have lots work
                                  also. Students are doing online classes by using electronic
                                  devices like android mobile phone, laptop etc but being playful
                                  they are also prone to playing online games or online chatting


                                  294]]></page><page Index="296"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  which is hard to detect. So it is another challenge for the
                                  parents.
                                    Few Suggestions to meet the Challenges:
                                    1. Teachers and parents should motivate the child for their
                                       online classes.
                                    2. Teacher should grow the interest of the students for
                                       online classes by adopting the interesting technique for
                                       the classes.
                                    3. Teachers should take different online training for how to
                                       conduct online classes efficiently and attractively through
                                       Google slide, power point presentation etc.
                                    4. Management and authorities of the school or colleges or
                                       universities should provide the facilities for online classes
                                       like internet facilities, video recording facilities etc.

                                    5. Parents must keep regular touch with the teachers because
                                       otherwise they cannot understand what their child is
                                       doing i.e. they are doing class or bunking the class.
                                    6. Parents should ask teacher about their child progress and
                                       if and when they are found lacking etc.

                                  Education and critical thinking are the backbone of any nation
                                  and but Covid-19 pandemic dealt a severe blow to the system
                                  in vogue. We faced many problems when our education system
                                  underwent a rapid change from offline to online mode in the
                                  wake of the pandemic. The present study attempts to unravel
                                  the challenges of online education and simultaneously the
                                  authors of this paper offer some important suggestions to
                                  overcome those difficulties. Our country also took an important
                                  role in this critical juncture by introducing various types of
                                  online educational initiatives. This study also highlights some
                                  of those initiatives by the Government of India.

                                    Education is our basic right and it helps a society to grow
                                  up. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic all educational institutions


                                                                                     297]]></page><page Index="299"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  were shut across the world. Over 1.2 billion students are unable
                                  to attend physically the traditional classroom. As a result, a
                                  drastic change has occurred in education, which makes it
                                  imperative to bank more upon e-learning, whereby teaching is
                                  undertaken remotely and on digital platforms. Online learning
                                  has become the only solution as people have to maintain social
                                  distance as well as education system couldn’t be allowed to
                                  collapse. Corona Virus changes the meaning of education, the
                                  mode of discussion, delivery as well as data collection for
                                  research. Online learning changes the way and mode of
                                  interaction between students and teachers and digital means has
                                  gone beyond the traditional teaching and learning methods all
                                  of a sudden. A  well-developed online course, just like a well
                                  designed online course, can open up new vistas of learning for
                                  students.

                                    2. Online learning and it’s challenges and suggestions to
                                  overcome:

                                    It is a known factor that online learning is attracting more
                                  students for better learning experiences. But across the world
                                  such as in a developing country like India or in an under
                                  developed country many students are bound to encounter
                                  challenges that can cause hindrance in their learning. Here are
                                  some of the challenges along with the suggestions to overcome
                                  them.
                                    a) Students find it difficult to adapt to an online learning
                                  environment immediately after attending traditional classroom
                                  learning.
                                    b) Students who find it difficult to carry on online classes are
                                  losing hope. It needs to motivate them by providing more home
                                  tasks so as they can engage themselves with their learning.
                                    l Involvement of students during the learning sessions.

                                    l Have to make schedule time for learning and a study
                                       plan has to be followed strictly.

                                    l Have to stay positive towards e-learning process.

                                    One of the difficulties students are facing in online education
                                  system is managing their time. They need to plan and follow a
                                  specific routine to manage their time in an effective manner.
                                    d) Lack of computer education is a major concern. There
                                  are students who still cannot operate basic computers with MS
                                  Word and Power Point and they possess scant knowledge of
                                  how to deal with basic online procedure such as login in live
                                  classes, record classes, creating and submitting work online,
                                  communicating with teachers and friends. Students should be
                                  trained how to manage and deal with online classes as it is
                                  completely a new set up for education in a large scale. They
                                  should be provided access to support devices that can help
                                  them solve technical problems via phone call, video call, text
                                  message, email or live chat. They should pay attention to their
                                  instructors during the process of solving the issues.

                                    e) Student’s lack effective communication skills during
                                  online learning. Students should become aware of the importance
                                  of communication for better learning experience.
                                    f) The teachers are not always well acquainted with online
                                  teaching and learning; rather most of them are comfortable with
                                  and gone through traditional learning as well as teaching
                                  process. Proper online training should be given to the teachers
                                  before teaching students through online mode.

                                    g) Assessment is the most important part of online learning
                                  of students as well as teachers. At times it causes stress for the
                                  students. So, whenever there are assignments or project that is
                                  to be submitted online, teachers might face a lot of questions
                                  from students.
                                    h) Feedback is one of the most important parts of self-
                                  realization. It is a very effective way to improve teaching and
                                  acquisition of knowledge. So students as well as teachers need
                                  feedback for their performance during online classes for


                                                                                     299]]></page><page Index="301"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  improvement as e-learning is newly adopted by all of us. If
                                  proper feedback is not given it might lead to dip in performance.
                                    3. Post pandemic online learning and conditions for the
                                  successful implementation:
                                    Ø  Post pandemic online learning:
                                    l 2020 is that year where various educational innovations
                                       have occurred to make the universal access for the
                                       learners a bright possibility. Though one major challenge
                                       lies in securing universal for among the learners.

                                    l However, creative solutions have emerged to provide
                                       students and families with the facilities and resources
                                       needed to link up through LAN or WAN.
                                    l The year 2020 has also seen increased availability and
                                       adoption of electronic resources and activities that can
                                       now be integrated into online learning experiences.

                                    l Modern smart system comprising Zoom and Google
                                       Meet, have allowed anyone from anywhere in the world
                                       to join online classrooms and have allowed presentations
                                       to be recorded for  learners who couldn’t attend class in
                                       the scheduled time due to some other engagement to
                                       watch at a time most convenient for them.
                                    l A capacity to serve learners of primary level to higher
                                       education has thus now been effectively established and
                                       the next generation of online education can move from
                                       an enterprise that largely serves every group and all ages
                                       across the world.
                                    l The Covid-19 pandemic is also likely to have lasting
                                       effects on lesson design. The well-established best practice
                                       of hybrid or blended teaching and learning is a significant
                                       shift away from traditional teaching methods to virtual
                                       learning.

                                    Ø Conditions for its successful implementation:

                                    l In the Covid-19 pandemic period, in view of the critical
                                       importance of network and nexus, technological and
                                       administration systems should be upgraded for
                                       implementing online learning, and with suitable
                                       infrastructure that supports its access and delivery to
                                       leverage its efficient operation.
                                    l It is commendable that the flexibility and learning
                                       possibilities that have emerged from necessity are likely
                                       to shift and shape the expectations of students and
                                       educators through virtual learning. It becomes easy for
                                       all to handle the e-learning system.
                                    4. Online learning and the SDG agenda of education for
                                  all:
                                    The 2030 agenda adopted for the means of sustainable
                                  development by all United Nations members states in 2015, set
                                  forth the global vision of 2030. As its heart are the 7 Sustainable
                                  Development Goals (SDGs) which provide the benchmark that
                                  should be achieved by 2030 in order to leave no one behind.

                                    6. Online learning and Govt. of India or UGC’S
                                  approach:
                                    The Government of India has developed several online
                                  learning platforms with an eye to keeping uninterrupted
                                  education system during ongoing Covid-19 pandemic through
                                  the Ministry of Education and UGC. Online learning platforms
                                  developed by the G.O.I contain various courses that can be
                                  accessed by students, teachers, professionals and youth at large.
                                  Those platforms are as follows-
                                    a) Swayam, an online learning system website launched by
                                       G.O.I.
                                    b) Diksha, was launched by the Ministry of Education,
                                       G.O.I.
                                    c) e-PG Pathshala, created by MHRD.
                                    d) Swayam Prabha provided by UGC, IITs, CEC, IGNOU,
                                       NCERT   and NIOs.
                                    7. Online learning and equality challenges:

                                    Challenges arose regarding internet access to all the students,
                                  availability of technology in remote areas where from students
                                  are attending classes because everyone is not economically
                                  strong enough to avail internet facility as well as smart phones
                                  or computers. There are many more difficulties such as a
                                  learner who is dyslexic or blind or without consistent internet
                                  access cannot attend online classes. Educational institutions are
                                  completely closed during pandemic situation and online learning
                                  plays an important role to cover up the vacuum. This is
                                  widening the education gap between advanced economies and
                                  middle and low income nations as everyone is not able to get
                                  online learning. The closure of educational institutions during
                                  Covid -19 situation affects education system in a negative way.
                                  Rich and middle class parents are able to afford extra online
                                  tuition whereas poor parents couldn’t afford online learning at

                                  all. Better-off parents are more able than poorer families to
                                  spend money on resource and support for their children which
                                  naturally create a wide hiatus between the students at different
                                  layers of the class hierarchy with different economic ability.

                                    8. Blended, machine and flipped learning:
                                    After pandemic a style of electronic, online media learning
                                  as well as traditional face to face teaching is blended. Machine
                                  learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical
                                  intelligence based on the idea that system can learn from data,
                                  identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human
                                  interaction. Flipped learning is a method that helps teachers to
                                  priority-based learning, assigning students, lecture giving,
                                  presentation-based learning and teaching process. Whereas
                                  blended learning is tools and resource based education through
                                  Google classroom, You Tube, Zoom, Microsoft teams, Skype,
                                  Blackboard etc.

                                    9. New era of education faced uncertainty and insecurity:
                                    In an era of loss of family income, domestic violence, no
                                  money to pay for food led to insecurity and uncertainty of
                                  online learning and payment for internet facility is not possible
                                  in many households. Financial setbacks for families led to
                                  obstructers of e-learning; they are stressed because of an
                                  uncertain future. Uncertainty is something that will make
                                  students worried all the time. It puts stress on the mental health
                                  of the students as countries like India overtimes the learning
                                  pattern was traditional classroom with lecture and demonstration
                                  methods of teaching and education system is largely exam
                                  centric. This kind of uncertainty hampers the motivation of
                                  students to perform because there aren’t any exams, the
                                  assessments are little. So when the students don’t get to see
                                  proper result or could not evaluated or assess themselves for
                                  their efforts, their motivation naturally comes down.



                                                                                     303]]></page><page Index="305"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                    10. Various approaches of online learning:

                                    It is very obvious that adoption of coherent institutional
                                  approach to online learning will be easily accepted worldwide.
                                  It relies on senior managers developing appropriate strategies
                                  that reflect the needs identified by market research. Equitable
                                  and flexible process should support these strategies to facilitate
                                  the development of online programmed that bear high quality
                                  and regarded as credible as traditional courses. Supporting staff
                                  and learners to take full advantage of online approach also
                                  requires institutional commitment to fulfill differing needs. The
                                  voices of past, present and potential students can provide
                                  substantial insight to course planning and development.
                                    11. Pandemic research strategies:
                                    During the ongoing global health emergency it was a threat
                                  for the students to attend educational institutions. So there was
                                  no other alternative but to follow online learning. While in
                                  traditional education innovations of early pioneers are
                                  contributing to the society, the new generations will be confident
                                  with technology and self-improving individuals. Major world
                                  events are often held in countries where new generation can
                                  contribute using an inflection point for rapid innovation. Online
                                  education system or e-learning process is one of the few sectors
                                  where investments have not dried up. It has been made clear
                                  through this pandemic that the importance of disseminating
                                  knowledge across borders and to all corners of society has
                                  made ineluctable nature of digital revolution a reality. So, it is
                                  incumbent upon all of us to explore its full potential.
                                    12. Application of industry 4.0 in educational sector:

                                    In education 4.0 students will be involved in the creation of
                                  curriculum. Students’  critical inputs on the content of their
                                  courses will help create an all-inclusive study programme that
                                  matches their interest. This means that future learning curriculum
                                  will be prepared by teachers and students together.

                                    This article seeks to address the paradigmatic shift ushered
                                  in by online education not as a fashion but in the context of and
                                  framework for understanding the state of the emerging
                                  scholarship, new narrative and textuality today. The use of
                                  network technologies for collaborative learning has transformed
                                  education in the globalized world.

                                    Identification of online teaching, learning practices:
                                    This explanatory study examined teaching behaviors, attitudes
                                  and beliefs that reflect potential competencies for success of
                                  online teaching. In this study teaching tasks are those tasks
                                  performed during course delivery. An analysis is required to
                                  determine why highly rated teaching task falls into any factor.

                                    14. Quality teaching and research during Covid-19
                                  lockdown:

                                    The global outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic has affected
                                  almost all countries and territories. The outbreak brings an
                                  unhealthy environment all over the world. There are weaknesses
                                  of online teaching including feeble infrastructure, limited
                                  exposure of teachers, lack of information, equity and academic
                                  excellence in terms of online education system. Lockdown and
                                  social distancing policy due to the Covid-19 pandemic have led
                                  to closures of schools, colleges, universities and other
                                  educational institutions in most countries to avoid transmission
                                  of disease which led to online learning process worldwide.
                                  Thus during the e-learning tools have played the most crucial
                                  role. While adapting to the new changes teachers student’s
                                  readiness needs to be appreciated.  Learners with a fixed mind
                                  set find it difficult to adopt and adjust but learners with a
                                  growth mindset quickly adapt to a new learning environment.
                                    15. Rethinking of education in post Covid-19 era etc:
                                    The demand for e-education is not new, and the pandemic
                                  has only quickened its implementation. The pandemic has
                                  heightened the discussion around the existence of the pre-
                                  requisites of tech-infrastructure for the education vertical. The
                                  education institutions must look at evolving their digital
                                  infrastructure that supports learning anytime, anywhere and in
                                  any device. Many educators view the crisis as a time to look
                                  into and propose more flexible learning opportunities and
                                  explore blended and hybrid learning and combined synchronous
                                  learning. The strategic challenges related to ensuring
                                  undistributed distance education during prolonged closures are
                                  real. Educational institutions are now building momentum for

                                  their digital transformation with new learning, teaching that
                                  improves higher educational outcomes.
                                    16. Online learning and issue of funding:
                                    World did reasonably well in transitioning to online learning
                                  during past one and half years but this has impacted the
                                  financial wellbeing of parents and schools as income source of
                                  both are streped during pandemic. Not only that, unstable
                                  internet connections and lack of familiarity with e-teaching-
                                  learning tools were a hindrance. On the other hand, it has been
                                  felt that transition to online learning was done rather well.
                                  However, a major issue rather set back identified was unequal
                                  access to digital learning devices, as well as a lack of internet
                                  connectivity and little familiarity around the tools required to
                                  facilitate online learning in all sectors and classes of society.
                                  The priority for the government is to provide more funding, as
                                  well as addressing connectivity issues, particularly in rural
                                  areas and socially deprived and poor classes of the society. The
                                  Covid-19 pandemic has paved the way for a hybrid model in
                                  education, combining digital and traditional methods of teaching
                                  and learning that does not diminesh the need and responsibility
                                  of government to act so that progress from the past years is not
                                  lost. Quoting UNESCO, the report underlined that in high
                                  income countries digital learning offerings covered over 80%
                                  of the population, but that comes to less than 50% in low
                                  income countries due to both technical barriers such as
                                  insufficient access to electricity, internet facility and human
                                  barriers such as limited digital literacy failed to avail the
                                  facility of the e-learning system which resulted stoppage of
                                  education for Covid-19 for a long period.
                                    17. Online learning and children psychology:
                                    Online learning comes with its ineluctable challenges that
                                  can impact the children to a great extent. Losing motivation and
                                  sense of self discipline for study, are some of the major
                                  struggles that children face. These skills are extremely important


                                                                                     307]]></page><page Index="309"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  for building social relationships not only as a child but also as
                                  an adult. Although the newer generation is more internet savvy
                                  rather they are addicted to internet facilities, there are certain
                                  limitations of e-learning. One may be an active student in
                                  classroom but his participation and willingness to answer
                                  during online class may go down. Lack of personal interaction
                                  relating to their problems and solutions with teachers and
                                  students also leave them with more doubts. In addition to that
                                  classroom based interaction with peers are very important in
                                  the school years. It helps students with a neutral environment
                                  for social interactions that aids in developing skills like setting
                                  boundaries, learning cooperation, coordination, brotherhood,
                                  cooperation and empathy. Children during online learning
                                  session become self-centric and forget about building social
                                  relationships.

                                    18. Online learning and goals of holistic education:
                                    The importance of accessibility to digital e-learning resources
                                  is widely acknowledged. The World Wide Web initiative has
                                  played a leading role in promoting the importance of accessibility
                                  and developing guidelines that can help when developing
                                  accessible web resources. A  holistic framework is therefore
                                  proposed and described, which in addition to accessibility
                                  issues takes into account learner needs, learning outcomes,
                                  local factors, infrastructure, usability and quality assurance. We
                                  propose a holistic approach to supporting the development of e-
                                  leaning resources that addresses the following issues:

                                    l Usability;
                                    l Make learning accessible;
                                    l Making courses accessible; and
                                    l Adapting to individual, local political and cultural factors.

                                    Our holistic framework for e-learning can be represented
                                  through our framework as a circle in order to stress that the

                                  different components are integral parts of a ‘whole’. This is the
                                  approach to developing accessible e-learning needs to be holistic.
                                    Conclusion
                                    Online education enables the teachers and students to set
                                  their own learning pace and their own flexibility. It teaches us
                                  a dimension of education system; it teaches a vital time
                                  management and utilization skills which makes a good work
                                  study balance easier, though it has some major drawbacks such
                                  as it tends to create a sense of isolation and also there are some
                                  other limitations like lack of quality assurance and more
                                  functionality of tools rather than personal touch etc. In current
                                  circumstances anxiety, depression and disappointment may
                                  occur frequently during online classes that have to be removed
                                  by engagement, interaction and empathetic support. In fact,
                                  there are only a few other alternatives to online education.
                                  Some students without reliable internet access, technological
                                  knowhow, and financial drawback and lack of proper set to
                                  participate in digital learning, this gap is seen across countries
                                  and between income brackets within countries. Nevertheless
                                  the effectiveness of online learning varies amongst age groups.
                                  A structured environment is required because kids are more
                                  easily distracted and adults are more reluctant about online
                                  courses. They sometimes take it for granted and do not put
                                  proper attention to online learning. Everyone has to work more
                                  to achieve real success of e-learning system, whether government,
                                  software developer, students, teachers as well as parents. To get
                                  the full benefit of online learning, there needs to be a concerted
                                  and collective effort to provide this structure through a range of
                                  tools and engagement methods that promote inclusion.

                                  For more than last 20 months, the entire family of the world
                                  has been shaken by calamitous onslaught of the deadly Covid-
                                  19 virus. It has stirred and destabilized the normal lifestyle of
                                  human being. The entire domain of education was invaded and
                                  lost its symphony. Under duress the educational authorities had
                                  to respond by switching over from offline to online mode of
                                  teaching-learning. The present study tries to explore the notion
                                  of online learning platforms and its importance during the crisis
                                  of covid-19. It focuses on the different types of online learning
                                  platforms. Participation of government to foster online learning
                                  is also elucidated here. Moreover, this study also reveals the
                                  factual reality of online learning platform.

                                    Introduction:
                                    Covid-19 has taken up the shape of pandemic and astonished
                                  the whole world including education sector. Education related
                                  activities were obstructed for a precarious period of time.
                                  Schools, colleges and universities over the whole world were
                                  put on hold due to novel corona virus. To meet the emergent
                                  contingency government had to shut down each and every
                                  educational institution. As corona virus unleashed the pandemic
                                  shock, hence it was a challenge before government and NGOs
                                  to check the fatal spread of Covid-19. In this troublesome
                                  ambience the learners started attending virtual classes by staying
                                  at home. The entire movement of human being was restricted
                                  for a boundless period of time and the situation resembled a
                                  veritable litmus test for the whole education system. Offline
                                  education was put in abeyance but it was possible for a little
                                  number of private schools to carry on online teaching learning
                                  to maintain the academic transactions. Low-income private
                                  schools and government schools could not adopt the online
                                  teaching learning method immediately. They needed more time
                                  to apply this method. There is a requirement of perceptible time
                                  for adjustment with this new process. As the online learning
                                  proved to be an acceptable solution to surmount the challenge
                                  posed by the pandemic so the whole education system have
                                  been shifted from offline to online mode or from traditional to
                                  or virtual learning mode. Government of India has played vital

                                  covid-19. The universities, colleges and schools are endeavoring
                                  unconditionally to diminish the complicated situation by adopting
                                  several digital technologies. MHRD, central government and
                                  state government have commenced suitable initiatives to lunch
                                  new online learning platforms by preparing diverse arrangements.

                                  Students who are coming from villages, semi town, small cities
                                  and remote areas are not acquainted  with online learning and
                                  could not use and handle the online classes. They are very used
                                  to for traditional class. So, they encounter enormous problems.
                                  Besides, these localities have been suffering from sufficient
                                  internet connectivity. time does not match with the teachers and
                                  other students and missed the valuable classes. Economically
                                  backward students are not able to afford online learning
                                  gadgets. Highly expensive internet connectivity is unaffordable
                                  for them. It is very difficult and challenging time to survive
                                  their daily living. In the pandemic situation a large part of the
                                  people in our country has lost their jobs and become
                                  unemployed. Many families have been starving during lockdown
                                  period. Yet the entire family members are empelled to remain
                                  at home for the safety of their lives. The family which has more
                                  than one members but do not have sufficient room for remaining
                                  comfortably at home, they do not get enough space to attend
                                  online classes. And family which has more than one student.
                                  Also it is very difficult for a low earning family with more than
                                  1 student, to afford smart phone for them.

                                    Conclusion:
                                    In conclusion it can be said that directly or indirectly online
                                  learning has affected the whole education sector including
                                  teachers, students and parents. Online learning is also engulfed
                                  with multiplication and drawbacks. Some are disappointed by
                                  the demerits of it. Rest of the people who are capable to
                                  purchase the technology may have lack of knowledge of online
                                  learning. Technical faults are very common in digital learning.

                                  There is dearth of technical knowledge in our country. Though
                                  online learning platforms have several drawbacks, yet in present

                                  of the education sector during lockdown period. Students and
                                  teachers have been enriched with the mastery of technology.
                                  Government has adopted many steps and inaugurated more

                                  Abstract: Technologies have tremendous impact on the
                                  educational industry in the present time. Teaching industry is
                                  adopting new technologies to predict the future of the education
                                  system. Among these technologies, most educators recognized
                                  that blended, flipped and machine learning are the most
                                  innovative and effective instructional approaches. This
                                  innovation enhances the learning process and makes it more
                                  interesting and smarter. Blended learning combines both face-
                                  to-face and digital approaches that supplement the education.
                                  Flipped learning develops among students real time skills by
                                  providing practical experiences in class and theoretical work at
                                  home. Machine learning is capable of predicting the future of
                                  the education environment by adapting new advanced intelligent
                                  technologies. The purpose of this paper is to make a comparative
                                  study between blended, flipped and machine learning by taking
                                  into consideration their definitions, models and benefits in the
                                  knowledge world.

                                    Background of the study:
                                    Earlier learning was totally based on traditional classroom
                                  setting providing knowledge around the four walls, on the face-
                                  to-face interaction between student and teacher. With the rapid
                                  change in the past few decades, various new concepts arise in
                                  the teaching-learning field. Among them Blended learning,
                                  flipped learning and machine learning are most emerging in the
                                  knowledge delivery industry in this era.
                                    Blended Learning is the union between face-to-face
                                  interaction and technology-based learning in which students
                                  learn through electronic or online media as well as face-to-face
                                  interaction. In this type of learning a student can learn in
                                  traditional classroom teaching, while completing the course
                                  online outside the classroom. Here traditional teaching methods
                                  are supplemented with online educational materials and there
                                  are also opportunities for interaction, online assessment and
                                  training. Through this approach students not only improve, but
                                  also show much better performance than in a non-blended
                                  approach.

                                    While in flipped learning, student are encouraged to read
                                  the recorded lecture, attain the online collaborative discussions,
                                  digital research, and text readings at their home prior to attain
                                  the class, which will provide them basic knowledge about the

                                  the role of active learners and make good use of the assistance
                                  given by experts or teachers to elucidate relevant concepts.
                                  Teachers become facilitators and assistants, instead of instructors.

                                  automatically learn and improve from experience without being
                                  programmed explicitly. Machine learning algorithms build a
                                  model, based on sample data known as “training data’’, in order
                                  to make predictions or make decisions without being
                                  programmed to do so. It is an application of artificial intelligence
                                  (AI) where machines can make any decision of their own, on
                                  the basis of a data program without any human intervention.
                                  Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of
                                  applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, speech
                                  recognition, and computer vision, where it is difficult to
                                  develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks
                                  (Hu, J 2020). In 1959, Arthur Samuel defined machine learning
                                  as a “Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn
                                  without being explicitly programmed”.
                                    Most students in Higher Education feel that whatever is
                                  taught in the class is boring and is not connected to career
                                  requirements. They do not perceive the classroom climate as
                                  motivating or supportive. Even instructors feel monotonous as
                                  there is no place for any creative ideas in the class. Now we are
                                  living in digital technology and our educational system is also
                                  getting the face of technology. There are a variety of instructional
                                  methods which are implemented with the help of different
                                  devices, to make the learning more interesting, more attractive,
                                  and most customised that students get the chance of active
                                  participation in their study. So the purpose of this paper is to
                                  make comparative study between  blended, flipped and machine
                                  learning and we will see how these technologies are helpful for
                                  students in their higher study. We will firstly, define the terms,
                                  secondly look at their different models and finally their benefits
                                  or importance in higher education.

                                    What is Blended Learning? Blended learning enables the
                                  student to access the materials from anywhere at any time
                                  while enjoying the benefits of face-to-face support and
                                  instruction. While, two definitions of blended learning that are

                                  most frequently cited in the literature are- Graham (2006) and
                                  Garrison and Kanuka (2004) and also cited 2149 and 3116
                                  times, respectively (Google Scholar, oct 25,2018). Graham
                                  (2006) mentions blended learning as : “Blended learning systems
                                  combine face-to-face instruction with computer-mediated
                                  instruction”(p.5). Garrison and Kanuka (2004) define blended
                                  learning as: “ the thoughtful  integration of classroom face-to
                                  -face learning experiences with online learning experiences”.
                                  Their findings deal with the different challenges of implementing
                                  blended  learning  in  higher  education and with their relative
                                  issues such as institutional arrangement, pedagogical  redesigns
                                  and  influential  environments,  related  to blending of learning
                                  strategies and institutional policies. Thus, key words in blended
                                  learning are face-to-face and online instruction. Staker and
                                  Horn (2012) defined blended learning as “a formal education
                                  program in which a student learns at least in part through
                                  online delivery of content and instruction with some element of
                                  student control over time, place, path, and/or pace and at least
                                  in part at a supervised brick-and-mortar location away from
                                  home” (p.3).
                                    We can say Blended Learning is the middle portion of
                                  traditional learning and digital learning, where 30 to 79% of
                                  content must be delivered online according to Allen and Seaman.
                                  While in traditional learning 0% of content is delivered online,
                                  in online course learning 80% of content is delivered online.

                                    Moreover in blended learning as the name suggests, Blend
                                  includes teacher mediated face-to face instruction and computer
                                  mediated instruction. In this type of learning both teacher and
                                  student need to make adjustments Bañados (2006). For example,
                                  teachers need to acquire new skills such as how to integrate
                                  materials, how to use hardware and software, and how to solve
                                  technical problems. Students should also learn new technology
                                  and can become autonomous learners. We can use the both
                                  terms Blended and Hybrid course interchangeably as they
                                  possess the same meaning though they use different
                                  terminologies. No universally accepted definition is available
                                  for blended learning yet we can define it as the combination of
                                  both face-to-face as well as blended learning style.

                                    Blended learning models in higher education
                                    Blended learning can be used in a variety of ways in
                                  different content, so it is very much important to share different
                                  models of blended learning. Blended learning combines various
                                  models of teaching and learning styles, approaches and
                                  innovative technologies. That can help teachers to facilitate the
                                  purposeful and disciplined adoption of appropriate models of
                                  blended learning for an active learning environment. This
                                  section of the paper will present several models of blended
                                  learning in higher education. They are-
                                    Charles R. Graham (2006, 2007), in a classic co-edited
                                  book: ‘The handbook of blended learning: Global perspectives,
                                  local designs’  introduced three different models in blended
                                  learning: enabling blends, enhancing blends and  transforming
                                  blends whereby he described the implementation of a blended
                                  model according to the needs, interest and requirement.

                                    Enabling blends: It focuses on access and convenience,
                                  also offering students different opportunities to select blending
                                  mode according to their time and cost constraints. (Graham,

                                    Enhancing blends: It focuses on supplementing the
                                  traditional pedagogy and is based on the traditional educational
                                  institutional setting where most of the courses are designed to
                                  offer traditional face-to-face instructions. Here blending varies
                                  from course to course depending on the teacher’s skill in
                                  pedagogical knowledge and technological knowledge as well.
                                    Transforming blends: It aims at changing the pedagogy.
                                  Rossett and  Frazee in (2006) developed three-tier models:
                                  Anchored  blend deals with (online instruction provided  after
                                  classroom  instruction), Bookend blend  deals with ( pre-class
                                  online activities  that  prepare  learners  for  face-to-face
                                  sessions)  and  in Field  blend (online  resources  are provided
                                  for learners to make use of whenever they wish). The most
                                  empirical and theoretical model of blended learning for higher
                                  education is formed, based on the Graham  model , Rosset and
                                  Frazee’s three-tier modes. They are - promoting cognitive
                                  explanation, enhancing critical thinking, appreciating learning
                                  diversity and aid on problem-based learning, flexibilities,
                                  accessibilities of learning resources which encourage
                                  collaborative learning and constructivist learning.
                                    In 2010, Ian Robertson developed two blended learning
                                  models: alternative model (superficial model) and
                                  transformational model. These blended learning models are
                                  presented  in forms of video lectures (online recorded lectures).
                                  These models are related to most current developments in
                                  blended learning and attracted more viewers than any other
                                  models displayed.
                                    Alternative model (superficial model): Superficial model
                                  is based on four elements: location, media, separation and
                                  synchronicity. It uses different ways for delivering the content,
                                  with emphasis on the power and control between parents,
                                  teacher, students and the learning environment remain
                                  unchanged.

                                  event-based learning according to the time and experiences
                                  available for the students.
                                    According to Valiathan (2002) there are three types of
                                  blended model related to work -related training:
                                    l skill-driven learning, which combines self-paced learning
                                       with instructor or facilitator support to develop specific
                                       knowledge and skill

                                    l attitude-driven learning,  which mixes various events
                                       and delivery media to develop specific behaviors, where
                                       peer to peer  instruction and group work are essential.

                                    l competency-driven learning, which blends performance
                                       support tools with knowledge management resources
                                       and mentoring to develop workplace competencies, where
                                       learners must observe experts at work.
                                    However, this model is not accepted due to its mixed nature
                                  as it focuses on both learning objectives and pedagogical methods.

                                    Significantly Staker and Horn have developed models by
                                  reducing from the original six models (i.e. the face-to-face
                                  driven model, the rotation model, the flex model, the online lab
                                  model, the self blend model, the enriched virtual model).  They
                                  did it by eliminating model one as insignificantly different to
                                  model two and three, and by merging the model four and five.
                                  Finally, they came up with four models, which were - Rotation
                                  model, Flex model, Self-blended model and Enriched virtual
                                  model. They also noticed four different variants of the rotation
                                  model, they are-
                                    l Station-rotation model- This model is best for elementary
                                       schools, in which small groups are formed and students
                                       have a variety of activities to keep them interested and
                                       attentive. They frequently change their physical locations,
                                       to have hands-on activities (through learning games,
                                       instruments, or other physical objects), digital materials
                                       (most often using tablets).

                                    l Lab-rotation model- This model is suitable for middle
                                       school students as they are easily distracted and focus
                                       much of their time and energy on peer interactions. So
                                       in the lab environment groups of tablet users are formed
                                       which help them to keep focusing their attention on
                                       learning rather than on socializing.
                                    l Flipped-classroom model- This model is for higher
                                       education at the college/university level, blended learning
                                       mostly automatically translates into the flipped classroom
                                       model. Due to poor limited contact with typical students,
                                       the station model does not fit here. Through digital ways
                                       new learning content is presented before the students
                                       with which students interact outside the class. Here
                                       students learn the content through self-peace and do
                                       abundant formative assessment in a self monitoring
                                       mode and are able to evaluate their progress.

                                    l Individual-rotation model- This model is for high school
                                       students. This model works well in enabling the flexibility
                                       to accommodate different student needs, abilities, and
                                       interests. Here students can move individually to different
                                       stations by choosing among different options. But the
                                       degree of flexibility depends on the resources available
                                       (number of teachers, para-professionals, computers) in
                                       the classroom environment or labs.
                                    According to a 2010 study from the U.S. Department of
                                  Education, blended learning classes produce statistically better
                                  results than their face-to-face, non-hybrid learning method.
                                  This is due to the reality that a rapidly growing model not only
                                  increases the flexibility and individualization of student learning
                                  experiences but also helps teachers to make learning more
                                  flexible and supportive.
                                    Definition of Flipped learning:
                                    In 2007 the concept gained popularity with two high school
                                  teachers named Jonathan Bergmann and Aaron Sams. In the

                                                                                     333]]></page><page Index="335"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  traditional learning environment students acquire knowledge in
                                  a classroom and then synthesize, analyze and evaluate their
                                  learning after the class is over.  But this approach differs from
                                  the traditional model of instruction because it reverses the
                                  process of instruction and transforms learning into an interactive
                                  learning environment that supports active learning. In the
                                  flipped classroom students first acquire knowledge before the
                                  class and then during the classroom time they practice and
                                  apply their concepts and ideas with their peers and teachers
                                  through interaction. After the class is over students reflect on
                                  the feedback they have received from their peers and teachers
                                  which help them to further improve their learning. Flipped
                                  classrooms encourage “deep learning” or higher level cognitive
                                  skills among the students. While teachers involve the students
                                  in flipped learning, the following four pillars should be taken
                                  into consideration.
                                    F-(Flexible Environment): In flipped environment students
                                  are given freedom to choose how, when and where they learn.
                                  Teachers create flexible physical spaces in which students work
                                  either in groups or individually, times are also allotted to
                                  students for their interaction with peers and reflection on them.

                                    L-(Learning Culture): In learning culture, instruction shifted
                                  from teacher centered approach to learner-centered approach
                                  where students are involved in constructing knowledge as they
                                  are given time to explore the topic in the deeper levels. They
                                  also evaluate their learning to make it more meaningful to
                                  them.

                                    I-(Intentional content): In Intentional content focus is
                                  given on the conceptual development and procedural fluency of
                                  students. Here teachers decide what materials students will read
                                  and what material they need to teach them. Teachers adopt
                                  student-centered, active learning strategies methods in order to
                                  maximize the class time. These methods are chosen depending
                                  on grade level and subject matter.



                                  334]]></page><page Index="336"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                    P-(Professional Educator): In flipped classroom professional
                                  teachers are given more importance.  They not only continually
                                  observe their students during the class and provide them
                                  relevant feedback in the moment and assess their work. But
                                  they also did self reflection in their practices and connected
                                  with each other to improve their instruction, accept constructive
                                  criticism, and controlled chaos in their classrooms. Whole
                                  responsibility for occurring flipped learning in the class is
                                  handed to them. So, it can be said that flipped learning is one
                                  of the most exciting ways of learning in the modern classroom
                                  which helps students to develop both their practical as well as
                                  theoretical knowledge.

                                    Flipped learning Models
                                    1. The Standard Inverted Classroom
                                    Here students are assigned the “homework” of watching
                                  video lectures and also read the material that is relevant for the
                                  next class. And during the class students practice their learned
                                  material under teachers’ one-to-one guidance.

                                    2. The Discussion-Oriented Flipped Classroom
                                    Teachers assign students lecture videos or reading related to
                                  the next class subject — TED Talks, YouTube videos, and other
                                  resources. Then class time is devoted to discussion and
                                  exploration of the subject. This can be useful in subjects such
                                  as history, art, or English.

                                    3. The Demonstration-Focused Flipped Classroom
                                    This is suitable for the subjects that require students to
                                  remember and repeat  the activities exactly — chemistry,
                                  physics, and math —  here video demonstrations are available
                                  to rewind and re-watch. In this model, the teacher uses screen
                                  recording software to demonstrate the activity in a way that
                                  allows students to follow along at their own pace.



                                                                                     335]]></page><page Index="337"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                    4. The Faux-Flipped Classroom
                                    This flipped classroom model consists of those students
                                  who watch lecture videos in class — giving them opportunity
                                  to review materials at their own pace. The teacher is able to
                                  move from student to student and offer whatever individual
                                  support is needed.
                                    5. The Group-Based Flipped Classroom
                                    The class shares the lecture videos and other resources
                                  before the class starts. During the class students are formed into
                                  teams and work together on that day’s assignment. This  not
                                  only encourages the student to learn from one another but also
                                  helps them to know the right answers and explain to peers why
                                  those answers are correct.

                                    6. The Virtual Flipped Classroom
                                    This is suitable for older students. Some college and
                                  university professors share lecture videos for students to view,
                                  assign and collect work via online learning management systems;
                                  this helps the students to attend office hours or other regularly
                                  scheduled time for brief one-on-one instruction according to
                                  their need and requirement.
                                    7. Flipping The Teacher
                                    All the video created for a flipped classroom doesn’t have
                                  to begin and end with the teacher. Students too can make use
                                  of video to better develop proficiency through their practice
                                  and activities to show competency, or ask each to film themselves
                                  while presenting a new subject or skill as a means to “teach the
                                  teacher”.

                                    Bloom’s Taxonomy in Flipped Model
                                    We can see the pyramid of the revised version of Bloom’s
                                  Taxonomy in the flipped learning model by upside down the
                                  pyramid. Earlier, in the traditional classroom learning Bloom’s
                                  Taxonomy was used from lower-level learning (remembers,


                                  336]]></page><page Index="338"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  understanding) inside the class while higher-level learning
                                  (applying, analyzing, evaluating and creating) is practiced
                                  outside the class as homework. But when we use this revised
                                  form of bloom’s taxonomy in flipped learning students can
                                  work independently on the cognitive work (i.e., remembering
                                  and understanding) at their home before entering the classroom.
                                  While during the class time they can be engaged with the high
                                  cognitive work (i.e., applying and analyzing) under teacher
                                  guidance and support. And after the class is over they can
                                  evaluate their performance and create their own concept.

                                    Define Machine Learning:
                                    In 1959, Arthur Samuel defined machine learning as a
                                  “Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without
                                  being explicitly programmed”. Machine learning means
                                  providing machines the ability to learn and develop their own
                                  programme with minimum human intervention. Machines learn
                                  automatically and improve from its experiences throughout the
                                  process. In Machine models, algorithms are trained based on
                                  the different data programs in it and based on that data machine


                                                                                     337]]></page><page Index="339"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  makes predictions. We can say that machines behave just like
                                  humans, as humans make decisions based on their experiences.
                                  Machine learning can predict the future environment of the
                                  education system by adapting new advanced intelligent
                                  technologies. We can use machine learning for customized
                                  teaching and learning environment. Custom teaching and learning
                                  means taking into consideration the student background, student
                                  aptitude, each student’s learning speed and response of each
                                  student and it also provides feedback to teachers related to
                                  students based on processing the students real time data, so that
                                  the teacher can recognize the student’s lacking areas and can
                                  take essential measures. Machine learning is able to set goals
                                  for individual students and is able to explain the concept to
                                  students. Then teachers track whether students understand the
                                  concept or not. Accordingly, based on that feedback provided
                                  by machines, teachers make modifications in curriculum, topics
                                  and methodology. In other ways we can say that machine
                                  learning analyzes each student’s unique data and makes decisions
                                  automatically. Machine learning technology plays a very
                                  important role in the assessment process, as it  is able to
                                  evaluate tests objectively and provides feedback to teachers. It
                                  removes human intervention and prevents prejudice or bias
                                  from the process and makes the result more accurate.  So It can
                                  be said that in the coming days our educational system will
                                  reach new heights by implementing the machine learning
                                  concept of the curriculum.
                                    According to the US National Center for Education Statistics
                                  over 30% of all university students take at least one course
                                  online each semester. And with the COVID-19 pandemic there
                                  is no signs of stopping, this number keeps growing and making
                                  the online learning industry boom.

                                     Models of Machine learning
                                     Figure.4  Showing different models of machine learning.













                                    1. Unsupervised machine learning
                                    In an unsupervised machine learning model, unlabeled
                                  datasets (only inputs) are inserted and machine learning uses
                                  algorithms to analyze the cluster of unlabeled datasets. Without
                                  any human intervention algorithms discover the inherent
                                  structure of unlabeled data. Neural networks, k-means clustering,
                                  probabilistic clustering methods some of the algorithms used in
                                  unsupervised learning.
                                    2. Semi-supervised machine learning
                                    Semi-supervised machine learning falls between supervised
                                  and unsupervised learning. They use both labeled and unlabeled
                                  data for training. It takes lab-based data from supervised
                                  machine learning and unlabeled data from unsupervised machine
                                  learning, and trains the algorithms on the bases of labeled data
                                  (like showing some pictures or objects) and allows the algorithms
                                  to make predictions about unlabeled data.
                                    3. Supervised machine learning
                                    In the Supervised machine learning model, labeled datasets
                                  (including inputs and outputs) are inserted into the algorithms
                                  to train, so that machines can predict the possible outcomes.
                                  Methods used in training the supervised learning models are
                                  neural networks, naïve bayes, linear regression, logistic
                                  regression, random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and


                                                                                     339]]></page><page Index="341"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  environment and learns from it, based on its functioning it gets
                                  positive or negative rewards as the name indicates.

                                    Conclusion
                                    As we know all students have their own unique way of
                                  learning so teaching methods should be designed to reach all
                                  the students differently without any consideration of their age.
                                  Heavy integration of technology in education does not help
                                  students to outgrow their own learning styles. But blended
                                  learning supplement the traditional face-to-face system of
                                  education by partly using technology in education, all the
                                  learning materials remain online and learners can learn at their
                                  own pace and acquire the necessary knowledge and skills in the
                                  way that best fits their individual learning styles. Not only that
                                  it helps in balancing the classroom with both quick and slow
                                  learners, students learn with satisfaction. While in flipped
                                  learning students remain excited and engaged as they get both
                                  theoretical and hand-on experiences and the teacher acts as a
                                  guide, helping them to acquire real life skills (problem solving,
                                  creative, critical thinking, innovative etc). Students mostly
                                  prefer the flipped method of instructions as they understand
                                  class content better in a flipped classroom. Today machine
                                  learning is the most emerging and popular topic and its
                                  revolution in education will take it to high level. Over the last
                                  decade, there have been several challenges in learning, including
                                  language processing, reasoning, planning, and cognitive
                                  modeling, all addressed by the application of machine learning.
                                  It acts like tutoring, grading, making education more
                                  personalised, providing feedback on course quality, and
                                  immediate feedback to students. All of the three learning
                                  methods are still emerging in their respective ways. But various
                                  research is going on as to how to apply machine learning more
                                  in the educational system. In the near future, machine learning
                                  will be more efficient and likely to produce even better results
                                  than now.

                                  performed to analyze the data which has collected through
                                  primary sources.

                                    While corona virus disease (COVID-19) spread across the
                                  world, many countries decided to close schools   for maintaining
                                  the social or physical distancing policy to slow transmission
                                  and ease the burden on health systems.

                                    Corona Virus (COVID-19) is one kind of communicable
                                  disease which is caused through a virus. This new virus and
                                  disease were unknown when it broke out at Wuhan, China, in
                                  December 2019. This virus or disease spread from affected
                                  person to unaffected person through hand-to-hand touch or spit
                                  or body contact. It has created a globally health and wealth
                                  crisis which has deeply affected the way of human daily lives
                                  or life. In response to the corona virus disease (COVID-19)
                                  pandemic situation swept the countries world wide. Therefore,
                                  like every sector, education system also was affected, after the
                                  pandemic broke out.

                                    Challenges during Pandemic situation of COVID-19 in
                                  Education:
                                    Shifting from the face-to-face to online learning: One of
                                  the major changes of worldwide education system is shift from
                                  face to face learning system to online learning system. Facultes

                                  for students and students are also preparing their course or
                                  content through online mode. In this circumstance many teachers
                                  and students face many problems. The transition of course
                                  through online mode is also a big challenge of capability of

                                    Assessment and evaluation of students: Several universities
                                  already suspended their semester or final year examination,
                                  whereas assessment procedure continuous through online mode
                                  of classes. Transition from face-to-face teaching and learning
                                  system to online mode has a serious impact on assessment and
                                  evaluation. Implementing assessment procedure through online
                                  on those courses designed for face-to-face learning is a
                                  challenging task.
                                    In this situation Government has taken various ways for
                                  continuing the education system or motivate the students for
                                  self-learning. Therefore, they introduced online learning system
                                  for completing the academic course. Here we first understand
                                  the concept of online learning, understand the advantages and
                                  disadvantages of online learning and also what are the role of
                                  online learning during the pandemic situation of Novel Corona
                                  virus.

                                    Online learning is a form of education where students use
                                  their home computers through the internet for their learning
                                  purpose. It is more flexible learning where students take their
                                  course of curriculum independently from any time anywhere.
                                  Basically, these types of learning systems have focused on
                                  child centric education. Children from lower income households
                                  are likely to struggle to complete homework and online courses
                                  because of their precarious housing situations.

                                    2. Rationale of the study
                                    The pandemic situation of COVID-19 has affected every
                                  sphere of society including educational institutes. We know that
                                  education has four factors Teachers, Students, Curriculum, and
                                  Educational Institute. All these factors of education have been
                                  affected by COVID-19. For this circumstance the researchers
                                  want to study the attitudinal variance among Teacher and
                                  Students during COVID-19, especially its effect on Education
                                  system in Purulia district.

                                                                               level(2.71)
                                    From the table no-5, it is found that the mean score of both
                                  rural teachers and rural students are 21.47059 and 21.68182
                                  respectively. When the t-test was applied to compare the mean
                                  score of the both the groups it was found that calculate t-value
                                  0.171525 which is not significant difference at 0.05 and 0.01
                                  level of significance. Hence the null hypothesis is accepted at
                                  0.05 and 0.01 level of significance. That’s mean there is no
                                  significant difference between rural Teachers and rural Students
                                  in relation to the attitudinal variance of impact of COVID-19
                                  on education systems.

                                    7. Findings and Conclusions
                                    The findings of the study give an overall picture which are
                                  mentioned below :
                                    1. There is no significant difference between Teachers and
                                  Students in relation to the attitudinal variance of impact of
                                  COVID-19 on education systems.
                                    2. There is no significant difference between male Teachers
                                  and male Students in relation to the attitudinal variance of
                                  impact of COVID-19 on education systems.

                                    3. There is no significant difference between female Teachers
                                  and female Students in relation to the attitudinal variance of
                                  impact of COVID-19 on education systems.
                                    4. There is no significant difference between urban Teachers
                                  and urban Students in relation to the attitudinal variance of
                                  impact of COVID-19 on education systems.
                                    5. There is no significant difference between rural Teachers
                                  and rural Students in relation to the attitudinal variance of
                                  impact of COVID-19 on education systems.

                                    8. Conclusion:
                                    In this study basically researchers want to study the attitudinal
                                  variance of impacts of NOV COVID-19 on education systems
                                  among Teachers and Students of Purulia district. Through this
                                  it may be concluded that there is no attitudinal variance or
                                  difference of impact of COVID-19 on education systems among
                                  Teachers and Students of Purulia district. It may be concluded
                                  that there is no significant difference between male Teachers

                                  A good research strategy is the key to successful research.
                                  Without a clear direction, the researcher will not be able to
                                  reach its ultimate conclusion. An effective research strategy
                                  contains the clear objectives, data collection resources and
                                  various constrains that affects the research in different ways
                                  such as access limitations, time limitations, location and money
                                  limitations, ethical issue constrains etc. An effective research
                                  strategy helps the researcher to define that why researcher
                                  employing a particular strategy to conduct the research study in
                                  an effective manner. An effective research strategy helps the
                                  researcher to define that why researcher employing a particular

                                  Research strategy is also helpful for the researcher to use
                                  specific data collection methods to support the arguments. In an
                                  effective research strategy, researcher collects the background
                                  information and analyzes the data to reach a specific conclusion.

                                  work was on the field. I was given the task of interviewing the
                                  Chhau  artists of Purulia. For this purpose, I had to travel the
                                  entire Purulia. I went to the famous Chhau troupes of Purulia
                                  and eventually took their interviews and surveys. The
                                  questionnaire for the project was developed by IIT Bombay and
                                  University of Mumbai. The questionnaire was very modern and
                                  highly developed. It was very large in length and covered all
                                  the necessary aspects. It will help shape the questionnaire for
                                  my future projects. Everything in the project was good. It was
                                  indeed a systematic and careful investigation. I am research
                                  scholar at S.K.B.U. I am engaged with research projects and
                                  will engage in various projects in future. But this experience
                                  was a great reward for me. This project has shaped my
                                  experiences and these present experiences will shape my future
                                  projects.

                                    Introduction: Without a good research strategy it is
                                  impossible to conduct a sound and successful research. Research
                                  strategies give research a particular direction which eventually
                                  leads to the ultimate conclusion. An effective research strategy
                                  contains the clear objectives, data collection resources and
                                  various constrains that affects the research in different ways
                                  such as access limitations, time limitations, location and money
                                  limitations, ethical issue constrains etc. An effective research
                                  strategy helps the researcher to define that why researcher
                                  employing a particular strategy to conduct the research study in
                                  an effective manner. Research strategy is also helpful for the

                                  the arguments. And Covid-19 drastically changed the research
                                  methodologies worldwide. It paralyzed the old traditional
                                  effective methodologies. Thus, the research strategies had to be

                                  changed to conduct successful research. Because of Covid-19
                                  new research strategies emerged and the traditional
                                  methodologies were re-invented and re-imagined in the light of
                                  new technologies and conditions associated with the internet.
                                  So, research became completely online-centric or online-assisted.
                                  The social science research became online-assisted. In the
                                  online-assisted research both the traditional and online methods
                                  were used. Literary research became online-centric. Many e-
                                  libraries were opened worldwide as universities and colleges
                                  were closed. The soft copies of many books were given free
                                  access. Recently I was engaged in an ICSSR research project.
                                  In this paper I shall be sharing my experiences of working in
                                  that project. I was employed as a field investigator. So, my
                                  work was on the field. I was given the task of interviewing the
                                  Chhau  artists of Purulia. For this purpose, I had to travel the
                                  entire Purulia. I went to the famous Chhau troupes of Purulia.
                                  I went to Charida to interview Kartik Singhmura, son of
                                  Padmashree Gambhir Singhmura. I also went to Adabona to
                                  meet Padmashree Nepal Mahato’s troupe. Apart from that I met
                                  Nipen Sahis, a faculty at Sidho-Kanho-Birsha University Purulia
                                  in the Chhau  department. I also met the renowned Chhau
                                  artists, Debendranath Mahato, Chinibas Mahato, Rampada
                                  Kalindi, Hem Mahato, Giasuddin Ansari etc. They are all
                                  masters in their field. They told me many interesting things
                                  about Chhau Nach and also expressed their present conditions.
                                  At present there are many female Chhaudals  in Purulia. So, I
                                  met a few female Chhau dancers. They were very energetic and
                                  motivated.  It was really an honor to interview them.
                                    A  Note on Research Strategy
                                    Research strategy is a methodology that helps the researcher
                                  to investigate the research issue. According to Saunders, research
                                  strategy is a general plan that helps researcher in answering the
                                  research questions in a systematic way. An effective research
                                  strategy contains the clear objectives, data collection resources
                                  and various constrains that affects the research in different

                                  ways such as access limitations, time limitations, location and
                                  money limitations, ethical issue constrains etc. An effective
                                  research strategy helps the researcher to define that why
                                  researcher employing a particular strategy to conduct the research
                                  study in an effective manner. Research strategy is also helpful
                                  for the researcher to use specific data collection methods to
                                  support the arguments.
                                    In an effective research strategy, researcher collects the
                                  background information and analyzes the data to reach a
                                  specific conclusion. Some important research strategy includes
                                  the analysis of literature review, case study analysis, interview,
                                  observation, experiments, survey etc. In order to accomplish
                                  the research aims and objectives, the researcher used survey
                                  and analysis of academic articles strategies. Survey strategy
                                  helps the researcher to collect both qualitative and quantitative
                                  data and information. Researcher also uses academic journal
                                  articles analysis in order to achieve research aims and objectives.
                                  It helps researcher to collect relevant information and data that
                                  is related to the research issues. Both of the research strategies
                                  are helpful for the researcher to collect the valid and reliable
                                  data and information to achieve research aims and objectives.

                                    Online research methods are ways in which researchers can
                                  collect data via the internet. Recently the use of the internet has
                                  heavily increased. Internet has become a global source of
                                  knowledge. The pandemic has forced to everyone to move to
                                  the online research methods. Thus, online research strategies
                                  have become effective considering the cost and the present
                                  situation. Many of the online research strategies are related to
                                  existing research methodologies but they are re-invented and
                                  re-imagined in the light of new technologies and conditions
                                  associated with the internet. This field of research is very
                                  modern and always evolving.

                                    Apart from online-centric research strategies, there are also
                                  online-assisted research strategies. In the online-assisted research
                                  strategies, the researcher simply takes the help of the various

                                                                                     365]]></page><page Index="367"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  online platforms. In these types of strategies, data can be
                                  collected through the traditional methods. But, in the process
                                  the researcher takes the help of the internet. Throughout the
                                  research many things are done online and many are through the
                                  traditional methods. So, in this type of strategy the entire
                                  research is done with the assistance of the internet.

                                    Pandemic and Research
                                    Covid-19 has impacted the worldwide research. Because of
                                  Covid-19 many governments or non-government research were
                                  stopped. Government of a particular country conducts researches
                                  to comprehend a situation, to make policies, to know the
                                  implementation of the policies, to know the effectiveness of the
                                  policies etc. But everything stopped. The same thing happened
                                  with the non-government funded researches. Covid-19 impacted
                                  all types of researches, whether it is social, literal, clinical, or
                                  physical. Covid-19 made every organization realize that their
                                  strategies need to be updated. Covid-19 was a great hindrance
                                  to the university research also. It became impossible to go to
                                  the field and do survey or interview. So, it was necessary to
                                  invent new research strategies. Eventually, the academia started
                                  to think of new effective research strategies. New research
                                  strategies were invented and the traditional research strategies
                                  were re-imagined and re-invented in the light of technologies.
                                    The Covid-19 has resulted in unprecedented research
                                  worldwide. The global pandemic once again highlights the
                                  importance of research, stable research infrastructure, and
                                  funding for the public health emergency. The stakes in the
                                  worldwide pandemic have never been higher as lives are lost,
                                  economic falter, and life has radically changed. Ultimate Covid-
                                  19 mitigation and crisis resolution is dependent on high quality
                                  research aligned with top priority societal goals that yields
                                  trustworthy data and actionable information. While the highest
                                  propriety goals are treatment and prevention, biomedical research
                                  also provides data critical to manage and restore economic and
                                  social welfare.

                                    Problem of the Project
                                    Research is a diligent inquiry or examination to seek or
                                  revise facts, principles, theories, applications etc. Doing research
                                  sometimes is finding the solutions of a serious problem. In
                                  many of the social science researches, the researcher/researchers
                                  try to seek the solutions of a serious real-life problem. The
                                  research project that I was engaged with was about the
                                  performing artists of India. Performing art industry is a million-
                                  dollar industry in India. Thousands of artists used to live their
                                  lives through performing arts. But the situation has changed as
                                  everything is closed in the Covid-19 pandemic. The performing
                                  artists were heavily affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Even
                                  we came across with artists who couldn’t manage to eat during
                                  the lockdowns. The problems that they faced were not limited
                                  to a particular place. The same was the problem of the artists
                                  throughout the country. So, through this project we wanted to
                                  know how the Covid-19 affected the life of the artists, livelihood
                                  of the artists and their artistic practice. After knowing all these
                                  we will be able to recommend a few solutions.

                                    Various Appointments for  the Project
                                    This project has three coordinators. Actually, they are the
                                  ones who are supervising the entire project. They are the
                                  faculties of the reputed universities of India. Two were from
                                  IIT Bombay and one was from University of Mumbai. As the
                                  project will cover the various performing artists of India, so it
                                  needs heavy employment. The project needs many field
                                  investigators, research assistants, translators, analysts etc. And
                                  they should be from various parts of India. So far, my part was
                                  concerned. I was appointed as a field investigator. My duty was
                                  to interview and survey the Chhau  artists of Purulia. They
                                  selected me as I am from Purulia and know the Purulian dialect
                                  very well. My research experiences also helped me a lot to
                                  become a part of this great project. I did my job honestly. I
                                  completed the task that I was given in time.

                                    Data Collection Tools of the Project
                                    Data was collected from two different methods; one is a
                                  survey and the other is an interview. Survey and interview are
                                  the two important terms for the project. They have their own
                                  distinctive meanings. Survey is a set of questions that are
                                  quantitative in nature in this particular project. They are closed-
                                  ended. An open-ended question was added at last section of the
                                  questionnaire for summarizing the entire thing. The questions
                                  were divided into three parts. Questions were asked to know
                                  the condition of the artists before the pandemic, during the
                                  pandemic and the recent times. The questionnaire was highly
                                  advanced and developed. Experienced professors and
                                  investigators might have prepared the questionnaire. The
                                  questionnaire had four sections. The sections dealt with the (1)
                                  demographics of the artists, (2) livelihood of the artists, (3)
                                  their artistic practice and (4) few questions on their future
                                  alternatives. On the other hand, the interview questions were
                                  qualitative in nature. They were open-ended. The participants
                                  could freely express themselves in the interviews. The interviews
                                  actually supported the data of the survey. The survey data was
                                  numeric and the interviews made the survey data reliable. Apart
                                  from that, as the interviews were open-ended, so many new
                                  things came throughout the interviews which were helpful for
                                  the project.

                                    It is a very vast project as it is conducted throughout the
                                  country. So, keeping the vast data is also a challenge. All these
                                  keeping in mind, the help of the digital platforms was heavily
                                  taken. So far the questions and the questionnaire are concerned;
                                  the help Google forms was taken. A  standard Google-form-
                                  questionnaire was developed for the data collection. Using
                                  Google forms is free and it is very easy to use. We also took
                                  the help of Google sheets and Google drive for keeping the
                                  data in order and safe.

                                    Data Collection Method of the Project
                                    Data was collected both through telephone or meeting the
                                  artists face to face. Where it was not possible to get the artist
                                  in person or considering the Covid-19 situation, we went for a
                                  telephonic interview or survey. In my case, I did all the
                                  interviews and surveys face to face. As I am from Purulia, I
                                  was given the task of interviewing the Chhau artists. There are
                                  more than five thousand Chhau artists in Purulia. So, I needed
                                  to be very selective and diverse in collecting the data. I was
                                  provided with the Google-form-questionnaire link beforehand
                                  by the principal investigator. All the questions were in English.
                                  I had to translate them all. I had taken the help of the principal
                                  investigator in the translation as I was not properly aware of the
                                  context of the questions. After understanding the context, I
                                  translated the questions into our local Bengali dialect so that
                                  the artists can understand easily. After that I took the print out
                                  of the Google-form-questionnaires. It was sometimes tough to
                                  fill the forms in the presence of the artists. There were various
                                  issues while filling the forms during the survey or interview, for
                                  example, network problems, phone problems, disturbances etc.
                                  Thus, filling the survey forms on the print out copies was the
                                  best option and then filling the data in the Google-form-
                                  questionnaire at home. I did the same for my own convenience
                                  and also for making the data accurate. It was an online-assisted
                                  survey as many things were dependent on the internet but not
                                  everything.
                                    I took the help of the experts in the field to get the numbers
                                  and the locations of the various Chhau  artists of Purulia. I
                                  needed to be very diverse in my data and indeed I was. Being
                                  diverse makes the data more reliable. I took the interviews of
                                  child Chhau  artists, aged Chhau  artists, gurus, female Chhau
                                  artists and the regular dancers. I went to those who are very
                                  famous and even danced abroad and also to those who are less
                                  famous and have not danced outside of West Bengal. I went to
                                  the Chhau  troupes of Gambhir Singhmura and Nepal Mahato


                                                                                     369]]></page><page Index="371"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  who won Padmashree for their contribution to enrich the legacy
                                  of performing Chhau  dance.
                                    So, as a field investigator I went to the various Chhau
                                  troupes of Purulia and took interviews and surveys. I had to
                                  record all the surveys and interviews. For doing that I bought
                                  a microphone. I had to keep the recording of interviews and
                                  surveys for analysis. And later the recordings helped me fill the
                                  Google-form-questionnaires. The recordings also act as proof
                                  that I interviewed them. All the recordings were stored in the
                                  Google drive. I shared the recordings links to the principal
                                  investigators and gave them access to read it.
                                    My contribution to the project
                                    In this vast project I contributed something as a field
                                  investigator. My work was on the field. I was given the task of
                                  interviewing the Chhau artists of Purulia. For this purpose, I
                                  had to travel the entire Purulia. I went to the famous Chhau
                                  troupes of Purulia. I went to Charida to interview Kartik
                                  Singhmura, son of Padmashree Gambhir Singhmura. I also
                                  went to Adabona to meet Padmashree Nepal Mahato’s troupe.
                                  Apart from that I met Nipen Sahis, a faculty at Sidho-Kanho-
                                  Birsha University Purulia in the Chhau department. I also met
                                  the renowned Chhau artists, Debendranath Mahato, Chinibas
                                  Mahato, Rampada Kalindi, Hem Mahato, Giasuddin Ansari etc.
                                  They are all masters in their field. They told me many interesting
                                  things about ChhauNach  and also expressed their present
                                  conditions. At present there are many female Chhau  dals in
                                  Purulia. So, I met a few female Chhau dancers. They were very
                                  energetic and motivated.  It was really an honor to interview
                                  them.

                                    I was instructed to interview twenty artists and survey forty
                                  artists within a month. So, I took the interviews of twenty
                                  Chhau  artists and a survey of forty-one. Then I updated the
                                  survey data on the Google forms as I noted the data on the print
                                  out copy of the Google survey forms. After that on a Google


                                  370]]></page><page Index="372"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  sheet that I was given, I needed to update the demographics of
                                  the artists along with the recording links. I had to update their
                                  phone numbers and emails in the sheet. The Google sheet was
                                  shared; both the coordinators and I had the access and could
                                  edit both. We used to meet two days a week to report on the
                                  progress of our work. We used to meet on Google meet. There
                                  was a particular time period to complete the work. I finished
                                  my job within the time limit.

                                    My experiences from working in this project
                                    It was a very good experience working on such a vast
                                  project. The process was very smooth. Everything was happening
                                  in order. I was employed as I had the field survey experience.
                                  Apart from that I am heavily interested in research. The
                                  interviewers might have sensed that and thus I was selected for
                                  the field investigation for three months. For me the most
                                  interesting thing was the Google-form-questionnaire. It was
                                  very new to me. I just filled out the forms in the presence of
                                  the Chhau  artists and pressed the submit button. Immediately
                                  the responses are received by the principal investigators. And
                                  the recordings of the surveys or interviews support the responses.
                                  There is no need to report at IIT Bombay as they have both the
                                  responses and something to support it.
                                    My only task was to go to the field and take the responses
                                  from the participants. I was already provided with the
                                  questionnaire. They were taking care of the expenses too. I just
                                  needed to translate the questions into our Bengali dialect. It
                                  was a great experience translating the questions. The questions
                                  were specifically focused on the life, livelihood and artistic
                                  practice of the artists. It was obvious that the Chhau  artists
                                  were heavily affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Their practice
                                  was stopped for more than one year. Apart from the details that
                                  I needed for the survey, I learned many interesting things about
                                  Chhau Nach and Chhau dancers. I came to know about many
                                  new palas and the recent trends in ChhauNach. I came to know
                                  about Chhau Nach as a beautiful art. I got acquainted with the

                                                                                     371]]></page><page Index="373"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  most famous Chhau dancers of Purulia district. Talking to them
                                  about Chhau Nach were the most memorable moments for me.
                                    The questionnaire was very modern and highly developed.
                                  It was very large in length and covered all the necessary
                                  aspects. It will help me shape my questionnaire for my future
                                  projects. Everything in the project was good. It was indeed a
                                  systematic and careful investigation. I am research scholar at
                                  S.K.B.U. I am engaged with research projects and will engage
                                  in various projects in future. But this experience will be always
                                  with me. The experiences were everything to me. This project
                                  has shaped my experiences and these present experiences will
                                  shape my future projects.

                                  Abstract:  Traditional classroom models incorporate face-to-
                                  face instruction, referring to a clear, instructor-led approach to
                                  teaching in which lessons are scripted and highly structured. In
                                  this model, the teacher presents the content, typically in the
                                  form of a lecture, and the student becomes a passive learner.
                                  Recently, flipped classroom model has been introduced as an
                                  alternative, and its popularity has increased by especially
                                  among the teachers. In this article the researcher wants to give
                                  a detail discussion about the different aspect of Flipped
                                  classroom. The paper begins with a brief introduction about the
                                  concept of Flipped classroom, and then progresses to discussion

                                    Introduction:
                                    The idea of a classroom is no longer confined to the
                                  boundaries, now it has moved beyond the confines of the
                                  school to the home and much of nature. We often hear from
                                  students that I don’t like reading anymore. At such exhausting
                                  moments, they can return to the learning environment through
                                  technology and joy. Out of boredom he can return to a happy
                                  environment.
                                    The teacher will give lectures most of the time in the
                                  classroom, then give a bunch of homework with some examples.
                                  This is the traditional way of teaching in the classroom. This is
                                  how most teachers teach. In some places in developed countries,
                                  teachers are now using the flipped classroom method. Where
                                  students will watch and read lectures at home. Come to class
                                  and discuss, argue and solve problems.
                                    Flipped classrooms are one of the means to make
                                  education more meaningful.
                                    In traditional teaching instruction, the teacher’s focus is on
                                  giving more information to the lesson. The teacher answers the
                                  students’ questions. In the traditional classroom situation, the
                                  lesson is content based. The involvement of students in the
                                  traditional model may be limited to activities where students
                                  work independently or in small group tasks designed by the
                                  teacher. Classroom discussions usually control the flow of
                                  conversation centered on the teacher. Typically, this method of
                                  teaching involves giving students the task of reading a textbook
                                  or practicing an idea by working on a problem set outside of
                                  school.
                                    Flipped classrooms deliberately use educational technology
                                  such as online video to provide content outside the classroom,
                                  while class times explore topics more deeply and create
                                  meaningful learning opportunities, where instruction is
                                  transformed into a student-centered model. A flipped classroom,
                                  content distribution can take many forms. Often, video lessons

                                  prepared by teachers or third parties are used to provide
                                  material, although online collaborative discussions, digital
                                  research, and text readings can be used.

                                    Significance of the study:
                                    A teacher’s interaction with students in a flipped classroom
                                  can be more personal and less educational, and students are
                                  actively involved in acquiring and constructing.
                                    Traditional classroom models incorporate face-to-face
                                  instruction, referring to a clear, instructor-led approach to
                                  teaching in which lessons are scripted and highly structured. In
                                  this model, the teacher presents the content, typically in the
                                  form of a lecture, and the student becomes a passive learner.
                                  Recently, flipped classroom model has been introduced as an
                                  alternative, and its popularity has increased by especially
                                  among the teachers. The online model called “flipped classroom”
                                  poses new challenges that are different from the face-to-face
                                  teaching model. The flipped classroom model enhanced the
                                  active and independent learning of students, changed their
                                  relationships with their teachers, and encouraged innovation in
                                  the learning process.
                                    Therefore, a detail study will be needed to find out the
                                  different aspects related to the flipped classroom. In view of the
                                  above situation, the researcher thinks that this kind of study
                                  will be necessary for detail discussion about an overview of
                                  flipped classroom.
                                    Review of the related research:
                                    See and Conry (2014) provides a unique flipped classroom
                                  model for the School of Clinical Pharmacy. The faculty and
                                  staff were asked to watch the YouTube origami video “How to
                                  make a paper crane?” and the Prezi demo, build your own
                                  crane and send a photo of your crane to the coordinator before
                                  the deadline. Class activities include crane homework
                                  questionnaires prepared by teachers, assessments and feedback,


                                                                                     375]]></page><page Index="377"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  and reflections on individuals, small groups and large groups.
                                  This research seeks to make teachers more sensitive to the
                                  flipped classroom approach. In addition, such a teacher
                                  development plan can become a model for other educational
                                  institutions to modify teaching techniques when teaching
                                  pharmacy students.
                                    Gilboy, Heinerichs & Pazzaglia (2015) studied the
                                  implementation of the flipped classroom model in two
                                  undergraduate nutrition courses. Templates used in research
                                  allow teachers to design activities that can be implemented
                                  before, during, and after class, as well as assessments that
                                  incorporate Bloom’s taxonomy. It turns out that most of the 142
                                  students prefer the flipped teaching method compared to the
                                  traditional classroom..

                                    McLaughlin and Rhoney (2015)        studied student
                                  performance, engagement, and perception of inverse
                                  neuropharmaceutical therapy courses relative to an interactive
                                  online tool, and compared the results between the tool and
                                  traditional downloadable paper brochures. It was found that
                                  students who used online tools scored significantly higher on
                                  the final exam.
                                    Roach (2014)  implemented part of the flipped course in a
                                  one-semester microeconomics course and analyzed students’
                                  views on flipped learning. At the end of the course, I found that
                                  students had a very good impression of the flipped classroom.
                                    Objectives:
                                    1. To analysis the meaning of flipped classroom.

                                     ...a pedagogical approach in which the direct instruction is
                                  shifted from the group learning space to the individual learning
                                  space. As a result, the group learning space is transformed into
                                  a dynamic, interactive learning environment in which the
                                  teacher guides the students while they apply the concepts and
                                  get creatively involved in the subject (Flipped Learning Network,
                                  2014: page 1).
                                    Flipped classroom is an instructional strategy and a kind of
                                  mixed learning that reverses the conventional or traditional
                                  education system by providing educational material outside the
                                  classroom, often online. It transfers activities to the classroom,
                                  which has traditionally been considered homework. In a flipped
                                  classroom, students watch online lectures, collaborate on online
                                  discussions, or do research at home and engage with concepts
                                  in the classroom under the guidance of an instructor.

                                    With a flipped classroom, students can direct access the
                                  knowledge and the teacher acts as an instructor and mentor.
                                  With the inverted of flipped classroom model, students can
                                  design their own moments of communication. Within moments
                                  of communication teachers are able to zoom in on the deep
                                  process of application and teaching materials.
                                    The flipped classroom strategy will increase the responsibility
                                  of both the teacher and the student team. The main thing here
                                  is to help the student in the lesson rather than the teacher’s
                                  speech. For this, the teacher can use quizzes, debates, projects,
                                  problem solving, testing, presentation, role playing, blogging,
                                  online discussion etc. as techniques. This will allow students to
                                  learn at their own pace. Even if a student is absent or ill in
                                  class, the learning materials created by the teacher will be
                                  ready for them in advance. Parents can also view these learning
                                  materials and help their child to learn. There will be no burden
                                  of housework. That is why student can see and do it with
                                  pleasure. Students will experience the content before class with
                                  an indomitable curiosity and enthusiasm to know the unknown.


                                                                                     377]]></page><page Index="379"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  And the teacher will work as a director instead of working as
                                  a wise person in the classroom.
                                    Difference between flipped and traditional classroom:
                                    In flipped classroom students may celebrate more freedom
                                  whereas in traditional classroom students are less active and
                                  more disciplined. Hence in the present post-Covid milieu
                                  students must prepare for their moments of communication
                                  through the format of flipped class. Most of the time, students
                                  participating in traditional education have to do their homework
                                  after the contact with teacher. The inverted or flipped classroom
                                  method, however, offers personalized study. Students in the
                                  flipped classroom have more freedom and flexibility to learn at
                                  their own pace, which allows students to use their time and
                                  effort more effectively. The flipped classroom method allows
                                  for group study. Compared to teacher-centered lecture classes
                                  where there is only teacher-student interaction, a flipped
                                  classroom encourages not only teacher-student interaction, but
                                  also student-student interaction. Studying in a group can help
                                  improve students’  individual knowledge skills. The flipped
                                  classroom approach emphasizes the production of knowledge
                                  by the students. Traditional classes based on lectures highlight
                                  the amount of knowledge that can be absorbed in the classroom
                                  by students through reading and listening (input); however, in
                                  a flipped classroom, students are encouraged to exchange ideas
                                  through oral discussions and debates (output) about what they
                                  have learned. The flipped classroom method allows students to
                                  retain their knowledge for a longer period of time, compared to
                                  usual lecture classes where medical students focus on average
                                  for only 10 to 20 minutes at the start of the course.

                                       As classroom activities in flipped classrooms range from

                                       research, educators often reorganize the physical space
                                       in the classroom to accommodate these variations.
                                    l Flipped classroom needs to change the learning culture.
                                       Flipped classroom shifts the focus from teacher-led
                                       learning to student-centered learning so that students can
                                       experience the topic more deeply through more
                                       meaningful and active learning methods.
                                    l Flipped classroom requires intentional content. Educators
                                       evaluate what materials should be presented to students
                                       in advance and what content should be taught directly, in
                                       order to help students “gain conceptual understanding
                                       and program fluency” through constructivist methods.
                                    l Flipped classroom requires dedicated professional
                                       educators. The use of the flipped classroom method,
                                       especially the presentation of materials through digital
                                       media and technology, is not intended to replace
                                       educators. Class time is crucial for educators to determine,
                                       especially if students already understand a topic.
                                    Steps in flipped classroom:
                                    1. Prepare your  plan:

                                    Review your scope and order or state values and select the
                                  value you want to start for your first flipped classroom lesson.
                                    2. Develop an assessment:

                                    Now that you know what you want your students to learn,
                                  the next step is to evaluate how well these criteria show
                                  proficiency and how much students have achieved. In a flipped
                                  class, this assessment should be done in two parts. The first
                                  part should be very short and easy to assess as soon as students
                                  take the online content from the grade. The second should be
                                  a somewhat longer assessment that allows students to
                                  demonstrate their perception at a deeper level of concept. For
                                  both assessments you need to provide information that you can
                                  use to provide individual support to students in the classroom.

                                                                                     379]]></page><page Index="381"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                     3. Find instructional materials:
                                    Think about how you would teach this concept to your
                                  students face to face and then search the web for instructional
                                  material to replace your direct instruction. Start with sites like
                                  Teacher-Tube, Khan Academy, Ted-Ed, Quiz let, and Slide
                                  share to find free videos or interactive lessons, or try your hand
                                  at creating contents yourself. The biggest thing is that the more
                                  teachers are implementing FLIP and other mixed learning
                                  models, the better material there is. Be sure to thoroughly
                                  review any text to make sure it is appropriate for your students
                                  and that it adequately and effectively addresses the value you
                                  want to learn from your students. When reviewing material, ask
                                  yourself these questions:

                                    § Will students be able to evaluate after taking this material?
                                    § Is this material at the instructional level suitable for most
                                       of students?
                                    § Is this material enough to attract the attention of my
                                       students?
                                    § Does this material meet the different learning styles of
                                       students?
                                    § Is this content seven minutes long or short? (This is not
                                       a strict and quick rule, but longer material can cause
                                       students to lose interest.)
                                    § If you can answer “yes” to these five questions, then you
                                       probably have a lot of teaching materials that your
                                       students can actually learn from.
                                       Note: If some of your students don’t have access to the
                                       Internet at home, find downloadable content and ask
                                       students to download it to their device before leaving
                                       school.

                                    4. Plan in-classroom activities:
                                    Now that your students will receive basic instruction at
                                  home, what is the best way to use it during their class? Well,
                                  flipped orbits provide two main advantages. First, students
                                  receive direct instruction on their own terms and at their own
                                  pace so that they can re-read, go back and review, or move
                                  quickly to build understanding. Another great advantage of
                                  flipping your classroom is that it gives you more classroom
                                  time to work on activities that require higher order thinking.
                                  These are activities that students practice and apply ideas to,
                                  and doing them in the classroom without sitting at home lets
                                  you stay there to help students when they need it, leading to
                                  deeper learning. Choose a few different short practice /
                                  application activities for students to complete - some individually
                                  and some with partners or groups - to make sure that each
                                  activity you choose leads to your students’ criteria. In addition,
                                  be sure to choose a combination of activities designed to
                                  develop a deeper understanding (for students who demonstrate
                                  skills in the first assessment) as well as activities designed to
                                  develop skills (for those who do not demonstrate skills in the
                                  first assessment). Finally, think about the role you will play.
                                  Will you provide help to students as needed? Draw small groups
                                  of students to work together; or some combination of both?
                                    5. Roll it out:
                                    Some teachers’ feel that they need to set up a virtual
                                  classroom with their Google classroom or similar site before
                                  their students can attend the reversal class. Not true! You can
                                  simply create a short document that contains the following:
                                       Values / goals written in student / friendly language
                                       Clear instructions on what students should do

                                       Links to content used by students
                                       Summary of follow-up activities in class (this will help
                                       motivate all students to work.)

                                                                                     381]]></page><page Index="383"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                    Once you’ve created this document, show your students
                                  how to use inverted classroom models.
                                    6. Evaluation:
                                    If you’re completing this stage, you already deserve a high
                                  five for trying something new. Now, it’s time to argue, how was
                                  your flipped classroom experiment? To reflect, jot down the
                                  answers to these questions:
                                    l Did the majority of the students consume the assigned
                                       material? If not, why? How can you fix this issue?

                                    l How did the students perform on the first assessment?
                                       Were the questions at the right level? Does the material
                                       adequately cover the standard?
                                    l How did the activities inside the classroom work? Did
                                       all students have an activity or assignment that allowed
                                       them to develop their mastery of the concept?

                                    l Did you find more time to spend with your students
                                       individually or in small groups?

                                    Principle of flipped classroom:
                                    Principle of Democracy:
                                    Flipped classrooms are built on democratic principles. The
                                  teacher should be aware of the abilities of each student.

                                    Principle of Freedom:
                                    Students need unfettered freedom to develop creativity. It is
                                  possible to practice creative thinking in an independent
                                  environment. So students must be given the freedom to make
                                  the flipped classroom a success.

                                    Principle of Flexibility:
                                    Filliped classes will be flexible, where the teacher will not
                                  force anything on the students. He will change the syllabus
                                  according to the need and situation. There will be no pre-
                                  determined rules.

                                    Child Centric principle:
                                    The goal of all kinds of educational programs is to develop
                                  the underlying personality of the students. For that education
                                  should be student-centered, not the exception of flipped
                                  classrooms. Therefore, the education system should be designed
                                  with the importance of the needs of the students.
                                    Principle of Dividing Responsibilities:
                                    Responsibilities need to be shared among students. The
                                  division of responsibilities is crucial to remedy the problem. In
                                  the case of flipped classrooms, each student has to take
                                  responsibility for something.

                                    Principle of Positive Attitude:
                                    Filliped classroom teachers will have a positive attitude.
                                  They will always encourage the student. At work, he will be a
                                  novice in positive and constructive activities. He will have
                                  confidence in the success of all the students

                                    Advantages of Flipped classroom:
                                    The flipped classroom can be considered as a unique
                                  learning-teaching strategy for the teacher to make the students
                                  interested and focused on science subjects in the preparation of
                                  their learning materials and to give them opportunities to
                                  increase their inquisitive, creative and innovative abilities, as
                                  well as to ensure quality education.
                                       i. It especially helps the student in active learning. By
                                         taking lessons in this classroom, students can actively
                                         gain knowledge. Helps students to be free from
                                         emotional entanglement.
                                      ii. In this classroom students get the opportunity to learn
                                         at their own pace. This classroom environment is
                                         especially effective for those who are backward students
                                         and slow learner student.

                                      iii. Since students have the opportunity to gain detailed
                                         knowledge on their subject, they can gain a deeper
                                         knowledge about the subject.

                                      iv. Having the opportunity to learn from natural conditions
                                         through practice creates the conditions for students to
                                         learn better.
                                      v. In the traditional education system, the teacher usually
                                         chooses one way to solve a problem. But in a flipped
                                         classroom, students can use different methods to solve
                                         a problem on their own. They can also use different
                                         types of diagrams, maps, videos, audios.

                                      vi. As students take lessons in a flipped classroom, the
                                         spirit of cooperation among them increases, they do
                                         not become self-centered. There is real social
                                         development in them.

                                    Limitations of flipped classroom:
                                       i. Administrative and support staff have also encountered
                                         organizational challenges. They do not understand or
                                         do not want this culture to be transformed into a more
                                         student-centered pedagogy. Some of these can be
                                         identified as concerns about student performance,
                                         especially for student groups composed of different
                                         students. Students themselves may need time to support
                                         them in playing a more active role in learning, worrying
                                         that this means increasing their workload.
                                      ii. The flipped classroom requires a lot of patience and
                                         effort from the teacher. Flipped classrooms are only
                                         possible if the number of students is low. But if the
                                         number of students is more than it is quite inconvenient
                                         to organize this kind of classroom.
                                      iii. This plan is expensive, students who do not have
                                         internet access or computer may have problems in this
                                         type of classroom environment.

                                      iv. The success of this classroom largely depends on the
                                         students; the process will never be successful if the
                                         students are not aware or if they neglect their
                                         responsibilities.
                                    Conclusion
                                    The issue of flipped classrooms is beneficial for everyone.
                                  Educational institutes that do not have more qualified teachers
                                  will be able to give better teaching using this system, so they
                                  will be able to attract students. The benefit to the students is
                                  that they will get quality learning material and will also get a
                                  satisfaction through this type of interaction. The probable
                                  benefit for the country is that there will be an opportunity to
                                  create skilled employee in the country, which is beneficial for
                                  the society and also for the whole country. In conclusion, it can
                                  be said that government initiatives is not enough to make the
                                  flipped classroom model approach a success; it requires
                                  dedicated efforts of teachers, students and parents.

                                     Assistant Teacher of Sanskrit, Janapriya Nagar Janapriya
                                                        Vidyalaya,

                                                   Canning, West Bengal


                                  Abstract
                                  At this very juncture the true notion of virus and its effectiveness
                                  can be understood in the light of ‘Microvitum’ (plural
                                  ‘Microvita’) which is advocated by Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar aka
                                  Anandamurtti. Microvitum (Micro-Small, Vitum-living) or in
                                  plural microvita has a plethora of dimensions to maintain a
                                  balance between physical and psychic level in the entire
                                  universe. Possessing a certain line of demarcation, it cannot be
                                  characterized as either absolutely electron or ectoplasm rather
                                  something more than that. Microvitum is the minutest entity
                                  instead of atom or molecule. The collection of microvitum
                                  causes the formation of a carbon atom. As microvitum is the
                                  minutest entity and does not possess a structure like that of an
                                  atom or a solar system so by nature it is more energetic than
                                  matter.The methodology described here is purely descriptive
                                  and required information is collected from different primary
                                  and secondary sources. In doing so, the writings of Ananda
                                  Marga scholars and practitioners are investigated. For preparing
                                  this paper P.R.Sarkar’s “Microvitum In A Nutshell” is consulted
                                  as the primary source. Many secondary sources like papers,

                                                                                     387]]></page><page Index="389"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  journals, and article writings are also consulted for having clear
                                  conception regarding microvitum. According to their nature,
                                  microvita can be divided into three categories-positive, negative,
                                  and ordinary or neutral. Although the essential constituents of
                                  microvita are both ectoplasm and matter, positive microvita
                                  consist of more mind than matter due to the over-reflection of
                                  Consciousness on it while negative microvita are of more
                                  matter than mind. The only way to control balance among cells
                                  is to increase positive microvita which can enhance positive
                                  energy by dominating negative energy.

                                    Introduction
                                    Covid-19 is a very popular word as it is recognized as a
                                  contagious disease all over the world. It appears with several
                                  symptoms including fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath,
                                  vomiting, loss of taste or smell. Sometimes it completely
                                  appears asymptomatic. As data suggested, it first emerged in
                                  Wuhan, China, in December, 2019. In this short span of time,
                                  it has spread worldwide leading to an ongoing pandemic. Due
                                  to its variable symptoms and characteristics, it still remains
                                  invincible to control its effect noticeably.

                                    At this very juncture the true notion of virus and its
                                  effectiveness can be understood in the light of ‘Microvitum’
                                  (plural ‘Microvita’) which is advocated by Prabhat Ranjan
                                  Sarkar aka Anandamurtti (21 May 1921 – 21 October 1990). P.
                                  R. Sarkar was a multifaceted personality having prolific
                                  efficiency as a philosopher, scientist, economist, music composer,
                                  social theorist, social revolutionist, and a spiritual leader. His
                                  complete works consist of more than two hundred books based
                                  on linguistics, economics, philosophy, education, yoga,
                                  biopsychology, music, and so on. “P. R. Sarkar gave discourses
                                  on microvita over the short period of two and half years from
                                  December 1986 to June 1989, at the very end of his life”. As

                                  a president of Renaissance Universal (RU), he explicitly
                                  delivered his first speech on microvita at Kolkata way back on
                                  31st December 1986. In his first discourse, Sarkar introduced
                                  microvita as the “mysterious emanation of Cosmic Factor”.
                                  Since then, a plethora of discourses were given uninterruptedly
                                  followed by 1 discourse in 1986, 13 discourses in 1987, 15 in
                                  1988, 9 in 1989.  He has repeatedly warned us through these
                                  discourses that in the near future, there is an immense possibility
                                  of being attacked by negative microvita which will give birth to
                                  many deadly diseases in the near future. So “our task is
                                  gigantic and we are to start our research work regarding these
                                  microvita immediately without any further delay, otherwise
                                  many problems in modern society will not be solved in a nice
                                  way”. Its “mysterious” character indicates that it cannot be
                                  recognized as in protoplasmic order and hence the question of
                                  their protozoic structure or metazoic structure does not arise
                                  and it is characterized as the smaller and subtler than atoms,
                                  electrons, or photons in physical level, and in the psychic realm
                                  may be subtler than ectoplasm. It causes the creation of mind
                                  and life as well as diseases like COVID 19. Sarkar explicitly
                                  states that in common sense the disease is of virus origin but
                                  virus is vague term rather the term microvitum can be used
                                  instead of virus as the origin of all the diseases.
                                    Objectives:
                                    The study of microvita is emphasized to:

                                    1. Explore the cause and consequences of covid-19.
                                    2. Investigate Sarkar’s view on the true notion of microvita.
                                    3. Explore the fundamental characteristics of microvita
                                    4. Envisage Sarkar’s theory on the division of microvita.
                                    5. Recognize Sarkar’s theory on negative microvita as the
                                       origin of covid-19.
                                    6. Re-examine the position of Sarkar prescribed microvita
                                       to combat covid-19.

                                                                                     389]]></page><page Index="391"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                    Methodology:
                                    The methodology described here is purely descriptive and
                                  required information is collected from different primary and
                                  secondary sources. In doing so, the writings of Ananda Marga
                                  scholars and practitioners are investigated. For preparing this
                                  paper P. R. Sarkar’s “Microvitum In A Nutshell” is consulted as
                                  the primary source. Many secondary sources like papers,
                                  journals, and article writings are also consulted for having clear
                                  conception regarding microvitum. All these primary and
                                  secondary sources are minutely examined to prepare this paper.

                                    Cause and Consequences of Covid-19:
                                    Outbreaks of pandemic in human history have made our
                                  lives miserable since time immemorial. There were massive
                                  deaths followed by the most severe spread of Spanish Flu of
                                  1918. It is recognized as the first attack of influenza virus
                                  causing 500 million people’s infection and 50 million deaths.
                                  As per the microvitologist point of view, the cause of this acute
                                  disease was the attraction of negative microvita by the dead and
                                  rotten bodies of the soldiers.  After that this earth has faced
                                  many epidemics namely Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
                                  (SARS) epidemic (2002-2004) caused by SARS-coronavirus
                                  (SARS-CoV), then Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)
                                  coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in 2012, Ebola epidemic in
                                  West Africa in 2015, Zika epidemic in 2015-2017 and finally
                                  SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease
                                  in 2019 (COVID-19). There are so many factors involved in
                                  explaining the causes and consequences of this outbreak of
                                  pandemics. Some of them are as follows:
                                    Causes:
                                      1. Lack of proper guidance to control isolated, monotonous
                                         and individualistic lifestyles.
                                      2. Absence of proper value-based ideology to channelize
                                         ego conflicts, consumerist, and matter centric attitude.

                                      3. Lack of adequate sympathy to respect other forms of
                                         life like animals, insects and so on.
                                      4. Lack of adequate physical activity.
                                      5. Disregarding the ecosystem.

                                      6. Damaging cycle of the ecosystem by eating other
                                         forms of life like bat, snake, dog, cat and so on.
                                      7. Indulging uncontrolled addiction either addiction to
                                         substance like alcohol, tobacco, opioids, drugs or
                                         behavioral addiction like sex, pornography, the use of
                                         the internet, playing video games, biting nails etc.

                                      8. Entertaining unhealthy food habits.
                                      9. Adopting materialistic outlook and achieving unhealthy
                                         competition.

                                     10. Being a money-making device.
                                     11. Inculcating excessive pseudo-culture, pornographic
                                         literature, and an unhealthy education system.
                                     12. Absence of proper spiritual outlook to create value
                                         based social structure for sustainable society.

                                    Consequences:
                                    As a result of a physically, mentally, and spiritually
                                  unbalanced, unrestrained condition of mind, modern society is
                                  not only facing health problems rather society is constantly
                                  facing a multitude of problems including physical, psyche,
                                  socio-economic, political problems and so on. This outbreak of
                                  pandemic caused psycho-psyche-economic, political, cultural,
                                  and intellectual exploitations in every sphere of society.

                                    A number of health-related issues have come out such as
                                  cardiovascular diseases, Respiratory diseases, Liver diseases,
                                  Kidney diseases, Digestive problems, and white, black, and
                                  blue fungus are also one of the notable issues in this context.

                                    Microvita- A  newly defined concept:
                                    Microvitum (Micro-Small, Vitum-living) or in plural
                                  microvita has a plethora of dimensions to maintain a balance
                                  between physical and psychic level in the entire universe.
                                  Possessing a certain line of demarcation, it cannot be
                                  characterized as either absolutely electron or ectoplasm rather
                                  something more than that. Microvitum is the minutest entity
                                  instead of atom or molecule. The collection of microvitum
                                  causes the formation of a carbon atom. As microvitum is the
                                  minutest entity and does not possess a structure like that of an
                                  atom or a solar system so by nature it is more energetic than
                                  matter. Further research work should be organized for better
                                  understanding of its existential value as still it can only be
                                  inferred through inferences.
                                    Essential characteristics of Microvita:
                                    1. Microvita are the manifest entity of cosmic consciousness.

                                    2. All microvita are not the same, rather qualitative
                                       differences amongst different varieties of microvita are
                                       found.

                                    3. Microvita has immense potentiality to maintain subtlety
                                       in the three fields of physicality, psyche, and spirituality.
                                    4. As a living entity it holds some distinct characteristics
                                       like existence, multiplication, mobility, and death.
                                    5. By changing its effectiveness on the human mind,
                                       positivity and negativity can be controlled remarkably.
                                    6. It has psychological impacts that are transmitted into
                                       good and bad in the human mind.
                                    7. It can only be understood through inferences.

                                    8. All propensities are controlled by microvita.
                                    Types of Microvita:
                                    According to their nature, microvita can be divided into
                                  three categories-positive, negative, and ordinary or neutral.

                                  Although the essential constituents of microvita are both
                                  ectoplasm and matter, positive microvita consist of more mind
                                  than matter due to the over-reflection of Consciousness on it
                                  while negative microvita are of more matter than mind.
                                    Positive microvita: Intrinsically positive microvita is pro-
                                  ectoplasmic having more ectoplasmic staff than matter and is
                                  characterized as the most subtle entity in the universe. Due to
                                  its subtlety, it possesses the capacity to function or perform in
                                  the mental sphere, then it starts functioning towards physical
                                  level. Being a subtlest entity, it can move freely from physical
                                  to psyche sphere and barely move in spiritual sphere. Thus, it
                                  can function at three levels of existence in the human mind and
                                  helps to lead towards crude physicality to divinity.
                                    Negative Microvita and Covid-19:
                                    Fundamentally negative microvita are pro-materialistic,
                                  possessing more matter than mind staff (Ectoplasm). Negative
                                  microvita can only function in the physical realm and lack of
                                  balance between positive microvita and negative microvita
                                  causes degeneration in the form of several health hazards. The
                                  increasing number of negative microvita causes the spread of
                                  most of the viral diseases like AIDS, SARS, Dengue,
                                  Chikungunya, Swine flu, bird flu, Hepatitis etc. The outbreaks
                                  of Covid-19 is not the exception of the impacts of negative
                                  microvita which is seen to emerge gradually in the place of
                                  industrial animal factories, slaughterhouses and meat processing
                                  center throughout the globe. Such types of polluted and
                                  contaminated environments and foul-smelling environments
                                  attract and linger to spread plenty of negative microvita
                                  remarkably.
                                     For Sarkar, a virus is basically a cosmic particle. Virus is
                                  also a crude or negative microvitum. This crudest form of
                                  microvita is responsible for creating, evaluating, mutating, and
                                  destroying life, and thus it is the messenger of life across the
                                  cosmos. It is neither living, nor dead. It travels across the


                                                                                     393]]></page><page Index="395"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  cosmos through inferences. Whenever it finds a suitable planet
                                  and a host it exploits other creatures just to propagate itself.
                                  The purpose of the virus is to transmute the DNA and create
                                  life across the galaxy, across the planet. Viruses become
                                  dangerous in connection with the imbalance between positive
                                  and negative microvita.  The imbalance between positive and
                                  negative energy is considered to be the cause of occurrence of
                                  all diseases. This imbalance may occur either outside of the cell
                                  or inside of the cell. In case of balance among outside of the
                                  cell getting disturbed through bacteria, several diseases like
                                  malaria, dysentery, schistosomiasis, and so on seem to emerge.
                                  On the other hand, due to the imbalance among the inside of
                                  the cell, the abundance of lifestyle diseases may occur like
                                  cancer, Alzheimer’s, cardio-vascular, immune disorder, psychic
                                  disorder diseases.
                                    Several factors act to restore balance between positive and
                                  negative microvitum like propensities, behaviour, association
                                  with good people, friends, food, and environment. All these
                                  factors control the immunity level of the individual. As all these
                                  factors are directly linked to immunology, immuno-genetics,
                                  immuno-histo-chemistry. The immunological pattern is complex
                                  as the immune system is directly connected with the mind. The
                                  mind becomes strong or weak depending upon its immune
                                  capacity. All depressed, disordered, and unbalanced states of
                                  mind have a weak immune system and are considered to be the
                                  root cause of all low pH and low oxygen level that is the origin
                                  of all diseases. Low blood-oxygen levels have been a significant
                                  problem in covid-19 patients that leads to more hospitalization,
                                  application of more antibiotics, drugs and steroids. If the mind
                                  becomes disturbed and misbalanced the whole mechanism of
                                  the body to control balance will fail gradually. The outbreak of
                                  covid-19 is not an exception where the whole mechanism of
                                  the cell fails to communicate with each other resulting in
                                  complete destruction. The current pandemic situation indicates
                                  that society has to adopt a revolutionary change with the
                                  greater possibility of healthier individuals, sustainable social,

                                  and economic awareness. To combat this devastating present
                                  scenario, positive microvita should be generated progressively.
                                  Several techniques can be followed to attract positive microvita
                                  which helps to strengthen our immune system through
                                  maintaining a balance between physical, mental, and spiritual
                                  health. Including meditation, yoga asanas, vegetarian diet,
                                  blissful singing and dancing, discussions of spiritual topics, and
                                  chanting of kirtan  with mantras like Baba Nam Kevalam
                                  (“Only the name of the Beloved”) should be applied to
                                  generate positive microvita increasingly.

                                    Conclusion
                                    Modern medical treatment has become accustomed to
                                  excessive use of drugs, antibiotics, and steroid application that
                                  severely disrupts the whole cellular balance in our body. The
                                  popularity of the application of antibiotics, and steroids is
                                  evident with emerging physical and mental complexities. The
                                  only way to control balance among cells is to increase positive
                                  microvita which can enhance positive energy by dominating
                                  negative energy.

                                  Abstract:
                                  Today the entire world is facing the biggest challenge due to
                                  the Novel Corona Virus. The Covid-19 pandemic has left
                                  crucial impact on the education system around the world.
                                  Governments of many countries around the world have declared
                                  lockdown and have closed educational institutions to prevent
                                  the spread of Covid-19. There is no certainty when the
                                  educational sectors will reopen. Students are badly affected due
                                  to the closure and they are panic stricken about the uncertainty
                                  of their future. In this dark time, the education system should
                                  never be stopped. Even it is a big challenge not to stop the
                                  education system. So that most of the educational institutions
                                  of many countries have taken initiative to provide education
                                  through ICT. ICT facilitates online teaching-learning. Teachers,
                                  students, researchers are now accessing various digital platforms
                                  and ICT initiatives to maintain the quality of education. At this
                                  lockdown period, when all the students are having a barrier of
                                  social distancing, but ICT has reduced this barrier of social

                                  distancing and lockdown with the help of so many digital and
                                  online devices. All most the whole world is now going through
                                  ICT and they are using this technology thoroughly. This decision
                                  has controlled the horror stricken of the students and their
                                  parents during the pandemic. Students are gaining opportunities
                                  to keep in constant contact with their teachers, fellow friends
                                  and also with their educational institutions through various
                                  online modes. Academicians are effectively using this lockdown
                                  period through ICT. When most of the countries are going
                                  through a tough situation and the education system is being
                                  disrupted, ICT has made the education system effective besides
                                  maintaining the lockdown period to combat the COVID 19.
                                  Thus, the purpose of this study is to discuss about the usefulness
                                  of ICT in education during this lockdown period.

                                    Introduction
                                    The entire world is fighting against the Novel Corona Virus
                                  (COVID-19) which is originated from China. This disease was
                                  unknown before the outburst began in Wuhan, China, in
                                  December 2019. The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-
                                  19) has been declared a Public Health Emergency of International
                                  Concern (PHEIC) and the virus has now spread in many
                                  countries and territories. COVID-19 is now a pandemic. ‘CO’
                                  refers to corona, ‘VI’ refers to virus, and ‘D’ refers to disease.
                                  Formerly, this disease was referred to as ‘2019 novel coronavirus’
                                  caused by a new strain of Coronavirus. The Novel Corona
                                  Virus (COVID-19) was first reported at the end of the year
                                  2019 and it has spread in large number of countries, affecting
                                  the worldwide population. So that, the World Health
                                  Organization (WHO) has considered COVID-19 as pandemic
                                  on 11  march in 2020 which has spread to 113 countries. The
                                      th
                                  virus spreads through direct contact with respiratory droplets of
                                  an infected person (generated through coughing and sneezing).
                                  This disease is hitting at different speeds and intensity to
                                  different countries. So that, governments of many countries

                                                                                     397]]></page><page Index="399"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  have taken some restrictive actions such as local lockdown,
                                  nationwide lockdown, social distancing, isolation, and quarantine
                                  to control the disease spreading.

                                    The lockdown has crucial impact on each country’s wealth.
                                  The economy of the affected countries is plunging down,
                                  businesses are getting lose, educational institutions are closed,
                                  people are doing their work from home; the lockdown has been
                                  affecting everyone around the world differently. Due to Covid-
                                  19 pandemic, a wide range of public and private services has
                                  been suspended across the world. These services also include
                                  schools, colleges, and universities. It means this pandemic is
                                  not only creating global health crisis, even it is creating a
                                  global learning crisis too. Most governments have closed down
                                  the educational institutions to restrain the spread of COVID-19
                                  and have encouraged home-schooling of millions of students
                                  globally. At the peak of the restrictions in April 2020, schools
                                  in 195 countries were shut and 1.6 billion learners were out of
                                  the classroom, from pre-primary school to university (UNESCO,
                                  “Education: From disruption to recovery”). As the days pass by
                                  with no immediate solution to stop the outbreak of Covid-19,
                                  students are panic stricken because of the uncertainty about
                                  their future. There are chances to increase the dropout rate in
                                  both school and university level.
                                    Though the situation is tough but the education system
                                  should not be stopped, even it is an instant challenge to educate
                                  children at this time of crisis.  Even governments of every
                                  country have to ensure that learners will not be left behind
                                  during educational institutions closures as well as after the
                                  reopen. Therefore, UNESCO has recommended online learning
                                  and education technology to reach to the remote learners.
                                  Therefore, most of the educational institutions have taken
                                  initiatives to provide education by using ICT which led to
                                  convert the classes from offline to online. ‘ICT’  stands for
                                  Information and Communication Technology. The term ICT is
                                  used to refer to the convergence of audiovisual and telephone

                                  around the world have decided decided to combat the COVID-
                                  19 disease and have closed offline educational transctions. But
                                  education is a continuous process and it must unilize ICT
                                  during the parsent crises. ICT has made the education system
                                  and teaching-learning process more effective and independent
                                  besides maintaining all the restrictive measures. It has
                                  transformed the physical classroom into virtual classroom just
                                  to reduce the barrier of campus boundary and social distancing.
                                  Education through ICT is being accessed 24 hours a day from
                                  anywhere. It is easily accessible to wider students. Attending
                                  online classes by using ICT is relaxed and comes with the
                                  comfort of homes or any location for students, scholars. This
                                  lockdown has made education change dramatically, with the
                                  distinctive rise of e-learning, whereby teaching is undertaken
                                  remotely and on digital platforms. ICT has opened a new sky
                                  on teaching-learning process to make the education more
                                  effective and flexible during this dark time. It can enhance the
                                  quality of education in several ways: by increasing learners’
                                  motivation and engagement.
                                    Though ICT has some drawbacks or demerits but, it has
                                  crucial role in continuing education system during the lockdown
                                  period. As it is very much well known that the third law of
                                  Newton says that for every action there is an equal and
                                  opposite reaction. Again one cannot understand the impact of
                                  life without comprehending impression of darkness. Thus, it
                                  can be safely argued that there are some obvious controversial
                                  or irritated issues of this e-learning or online learning through
                                  using ICT regarding humanitarian touch or the passionate

                                  of 17 goals, it is a blue print to achieve a better and more
                                  sustainable future for all people. These goals were set up in
                                  2015 by the UNGA  (United Nations General Assembly) and
                                  are projected to be attained by 2030. The SDGs-4 is all about
                                  quality education for all. The aims of SDG-4 are to provide the
                                  quality education and other opportunities related to learning
                                  which will improve the learner’s skills, the lifestyle, and also
                                  the future of the society. At the very beginning of the 21st
                                  century, most of the countries in the world have faced a terrible
                                  condition due to covid-19. Due to this global epidemic, the
                                  whole world is being severely affected economically,
                                  administratively, education, health, etc. Schools, colleges,
                                  universities and other educational institutions are almost closed
                                  today; as a result, the teaching-learning process is almost
                                  closed. In such a critical condition, the use of technology has
                                  shown the hope in continuing the education system and also it


                                                                                     409]]></page><page Index="411"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  helps to achieve the goals of sustainable development related to
                                  quality education. So, in bringing the quality in education and
                                  to achieve the SDG-4, government should focus on the
                                  investment to liberalize conventional regulation and encourage
                                  public private partnership. We need to work in direction to
                                  minimize the existing challenges among the students. There is
                                  a need for improvement in communication skills between
                                  teacher and students and also to create and deliver quality
                                  content in online education quality teachers and technical staff
                                  are required.

                                    Introduction
                                    The sustainable developmental goals are the group of 17
                                  goals. It is a blue print to achieve a better and more sustainable
                                  future for all people. These goals were set up in 2015 by the
                                  UNGA  (United Nations General Assembly) and are projected
                                  to be attained by 2030. The SDG-4 is all about quality
                                  education for all. At the beginning of the present century,
                                  human civilization has become almost distorted Due to the
                                  COVID-19 Pandemic. Different countries are also being affected
                                  economically, politically, socially by the impact of this pandemic.
                                  Its impact is being widely reflected in the education system. As
                                  a result of global lockdown almost all schools, colleges and
                                  universities are closed therefore the education system is nearly
                                  stopped. But in the 21  century Science and technology covered
                                                    st
                                  almost every field, as a result of the utilization of science and
                                  technology has resolved varied issues of human civilization. By
                                  the help of ICT, we may achieve the SDG agenda of Education
                                  for all. Various online classes, radio conferences, video
                                  conferencing, webinars, online workshops are being organized
                                  to keep the learning process moving through the use of science
                                  and technology. But still there are some issues and challenges
                                  in implementing the education process through online mode.
                                  Both the teachers and students are facing various kind of

                                  problems in online mode of learning which is bringing obstacles
                                  for achieving the SDG agenda of education for all.
                                    In this paper author highlights the varied problems and
                                  challenges involving transmission education through online
                                  mode to full fill the SDG agenda of Education for All during
                                  this epidemic situation.
                                    The idea of sustainability in education was addressed
                                  internationally first time by the International Union for
                                  Conservation of Nature conference held in 1948. After this a
                                  number of international, national, regional declarations were
                                  issued relating to the higher educational institution (HEIs) and
                                  environmentally sustainable issues. The World Commission on
                                  Environment and Development (1987) was known for
                                  introducing the term “Sustainable Development”. In 2015, with
                                  the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the world’s
                                  leaders set out on an ambitious path to end poverty, fight
                                  inequality, justice, protect the planet. The member state of the
                                  United Nations unanimously agreed upon the 17 SDGs making
                                  them the world’s agenda for sustainable development. The
                                  SGDs provide a coherent, holistic, integrated framework for
                                  addressing the world’s most urgent sustainability challenges
                                  and creating a better future for all. Sustainable Development is
                                  a way for people to use resources without causing depletion of
                                  resources for future generation. The term used by the Brundtland
                                  Commission defined it as development that ‘meets the needs of
                                  the present without compromising the ability of future generation
                                  to meet their own needs’ (Khan, 2020).

                                    The sustainable developmental goals are the group of 17
                                  goals; it is a blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable
                                  future for all people. These goals were set up in 2015 by the
                                  UNGA  (United Nations General Assembly) and are projected
                                  to be attained by 2030. The SDGs-4 is all about quality
                                  education for all. The full title of SDG-4 is ‘Ensure inclusive
                                  and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning
                                  opportunities for all’  (UNDP, 2021)

                                  we are able to keep the education process afloat and also
                                  provide the quality education for all through online mode of
                                  learning even in this pandemic condition.

                                    SDG  agenda of Education for  All:

                                  and also the future of the society. The SDG-4 is consisted of 10
                                  targets (UNDP, 2021)

                                    Target-1: Free primary and secondary education.

                                    Impact of Covid-19 Pandemic:
                                    COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most
                                  recently discovered Coronavirus. This new virus and disease
                                  were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China at
                                                                         th
                                  the end of 2019 (WHO, 2020). On March 11  it was declared
                                  to be a pandemic. This endemic is now affecting most of the
                                  countries. Most of the highly developed nations are almost
                                  collapsed due to corona outburst. Subsequently India is also
                                  affecting in various aspect like health, commerce, education
                                  and many more (Khanna, 2020).
                                    Due to COVID-19 pandemic the SDG-4 is likely to be
                                  missed. The field of education in India is passing through
                                  critical condition. Everything related to education like teaching,
                                  learning, examination, evaluation and others co-curricular
                                  activities are totally stopped due to covid-19 pandemic. In this
                                  situation only the technology can help to run the education
                                  system. With the help of various Technological gadget or
                                  devices we can continue the education process through online
                                  mode of learning.
                                    Online Learning and Online Education:
                                    Online learning is a part of E-learning. E-learning refers to
                                  the use of information and communication technology to enable
                                  or access the online learning and teaching-learning resources.
                                  Online learning is generally utilizing electronic technology to
                                  access educational curriculum outside of a traditional classroom.
                                  The use of E-learning is generally confined to ‘Online Learning’

                                                                                     413]]></page><page Index="415"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                    In this Covid-19 pandemic the whole education system is
                                  depends on online mode of learning. Many educational
                                  institutions are attempting to provide education through online
                                  mode, but there are some problems and issues to provide
                                  quality education for all. The pandemic has also caused to an
                                  increase in educational inequalities for the students who belong
                                  to poor families (Leal, 2020). As a result, various administrative
                                  and educational activities are being hampered, Teachers are
                                  facing many problems or difficulties to do their duties fruitfully,

                                    In the 21st century the enhancement of technology and
                                  science is in extreme position but still in the field of education
                                  both teachers and students do not have not enough and adequate
                                  knowledge and skills to use various technological tools, gadgets,
                                  devices, software hardware etc. Although many teachers have
                                  some knowledge to use technology yet they do not have
                                  adequate skills in how to use technology to impart education in
                                  online mode. Technology is currently the only hope to keep the
                                  education process running in the stressful conditions of Covid-
                                  19 pandemic. However, there is a lack of sufficient skills

                                  a result, teachers are currently facing various problems in
                                  teaching through the use of technology.

                                    Digital divide is a major issue in learning through online
                                  education. We know that India is a developing country, so most
                                  of the students hail from poor family and from the segment of
                                  low the socio-economic status in India. It is very costly to
                                  continue the education system through online education because
                                  the cost of various types’ materials like Mobile, Tabs, Computers,
                                  Laptops, Internet connection is very expensive. The students
                                  from rural and backward places are facing difficulties to study
                                  through online. Not only the device or gadget but also the
                                  network connectivity plays a major role in online education.
                                  Nowadays by using the internet, we can learn newer things
                                  whenever we want but it requires strong network connectivity.
                                  While network connectivity is good in urban areas but the
                                  students of rural and backward areas face teething problems
                                  regarding connectivity. Most of the rural students and teachers
                                  cannot use technology properly due to lack of internet facility
                                  and strong connectivity and cannot engage in various online
                                  learning platforms. Although the students have the opportunity
                                  to use technology but they are not getting the authentic and
                                  appropriate learning material, which has become unable to
                                  meet the needs of all types of students. Our education also
                                  focused on learning by doing; so, every student must have
                                  practical knowledge regarding of their subject, but it is very
                                  difficult in online classroom or online learning. There is no
                                  opportunity to do practical work in online learning because of
                                  various reasons. As a result, the students have theoretical
                                  knowledge about the subject matter but they don’t have any
                                  practical knowledge regard this.
                                    India is a widely diversified, multi-cultural and multi-
                                  linguistic country that process many challenges such as loss of
                                  uniformity and quality. Every student can’t able to speak with
                                  same language. Therefore, the issues related to language
                                  problems become a major obstacle in online education. Most of
                                  the learning material of online platform available in English
                                  language, so students feel difficulties in understanding and
                                  reading the content as they are not confident in English.

                                    Online learning makes the student-teacher relationship
                                  mechanical and it also decreases the human contact day by day.
                                  So, it also reduces the level of motivation of the students. The
                                  use of educational technology is greatly reducing the
                                  concentration, interest and motivation of the students. As a
                                  result of this it’s making the teaching-learning process too
                                  mechanical. In the online classes there is no opportunity to
                                  discuss practical works. So, most of the students feel bored in
                                  that kind of Classroom. Excessive and prolonged use of various
                                  technological devices and gadgets in education also creates a
                                  kind of annoying and chaotic environment and is hampering
                                  our physical health and putting pressure on our mental health.
                                  By using technology and science we reduce our labour and
                                  time but too much dependency on technology brings laziness
                                  and it’s also hampering out creativity. Due to excessive use of
                                  technology, it is reducing our levels of thinking process (Stein,
                                  2011).

                                    Confidentiality or privacy is a major issue in online platforms.
                                  The security and safety are very much needed in online
                                  learning platforms. The misuse of technology in education has
                                  created a chaos condition.

                                    Conclusion:
                                    At the end we can say that the effect of pandemic is
                                  negative on education system. Most of the students were
                                  deprived of formal education during Covid-19 outbreak. Many
                                  educational institutes are closed due to pandemic, but technology
                                  gives us a new stage of whole education system. Many
                                  institutions are trying to maintain academic program through
                                  online mode. However, the quality, equality and equity remain
                                  a major problem to access learning process through online
                                  education. In this field of education, technology faces different
                                  challenges to continue education but we must remember that
                                  every problem has a solution. To achieve the sustainable
                                  developmental goals of quality education, government must
                                  focus on those issues to maintain the quality and equality of

                                  education. In this case we must need some appropriate planning
                                  and high level of research to organizing the online learning. As
                                  a result, in this covid-19 pandemic, we have to adapt all the
                                  changes in the education system so that we can overcome all
                                  the difficulties of online education and make the teaching-
                                  learning system easier and effective.
                                    Hence, we can say that in bringing the quality in education
                                  and to achieve the SDG-4, government should focus on the
                                  investment to liberalize conventional regulation and encourage
                                  public private partnership. We need to work in direction to
                                  minimize the existing challenges among the students. There is
                                  a need for improvement in communication skills between
                                  teacher and students and also to create and deliver quality
                                  content in online education quality teachers and technical staff

                                  Abstract: COVID-19 creates an epidemic situation in the
                                  whole world. As a result, there is a soul-stirring situation in
                                  many developed and undeveloped countries. India as a big
                                  country has also faced many problems in many fields like
                                  health, commerce, education, trade, etc. All through the world,
                                  the schools, colleges, universities and other educational institutes
                                  are temporarily shut down but the education should not be
                                  halted as because education is a continuous, dynamic and
                                  lifelong process. Hence we must continue it with the help of
                                  online education to fulfill the value of the requirements of
                                  education. Many institutes provide online classes and video
                                  conference for imparting education. However, at present schools,
                                  colleges, university students are facing various problems in
                                  their study and learning. Since all students are confined to their
                                  houses so that their attention power getting reduced. We know
                                  that attention is a most important factor in education but due to
                                  this situation every student lacks interest towards study. They
                                  are not paying adequate won’t pay more attention to their study.

                                  However, it is clear that COVID-19 pandemic deeply obstructs
                                  our education system and hampers students learning. In this
                                  pandemic situation the Online classroom is playing a vital role
                                  to imparting education but the online classroom can’t be a
                                  substitute of real classroom. We know that education is the
                                  backbone of the society, so we never stop our education
                                  system. In this situation we can try to improve our education
                                  system through various type of psychological methods with the
                                  help of science and technology.

                                    Introduction
                                    The deadly COVID-19 has created a pandemic situation in
                                  the whole world. As a result, there is a soul-stirring situation in
                                  many developed and undeveloped countries. As a big country
                                  India has also faced many problems in many fields like health,
                                  commerce, education, trade, etc. Through out the world, the
                                  schools, colleges, universities and other educational institutes
                                  are temporarily shut down but the education should not be
                                  halted as because education is a continuous, dynamic and
                                  lifelong process. Now instead of traditional education we must
                                  continue it with the help of online education to fulfill the
                                  requirements of education. Many institutes have come forword
                                  to provide online classes and video conference for imparting
                                  education. However, at present schools, colleges, university
                                  students are facing various problems in their study and learning.
                                  We know that every student belongs to various socio-economic
                                  context; that’s why their needs, interests, attitude, aptitude are
                                  different to each other. As a result of this lockdown every
                                  student experienced many problems like mental health issues,
                                  economic problem, academic problem etc. Students at every
                                  level are affected by this, so it is very important to know and
                                  solve all the problems they are facing at this time.
                                    In this paper the author wants to discuss many such
                                  problems faced by the students of various universities of India

                                  during lockdown and he also wants to highlight what will be
                                  probable remedies to solve these problems. The era of 21 th
                                  century has changed the world history completely from political
                                  perspective, economical perspective, cultural perspective,
                                  technological perspective and so on. New technologies are
                                  gradually altered society with a new life style. But the present
                                  COVID-19 situation forces human society to lose into dark
                                  alleys. Many countries have enforced various strict rules which
                                  have affected their economy, politics, culture and last but not
                                  the least, education gravely. The outbreak of this virus is now
                                  proliferating. With it, poverty and unemployment are also
                                  growing. It results in social deterioration, economic downfall
                                  and political division. At present we are slowly moving towards
                                  a dangerous condition. All are likely to hear the footsteps of
                                  famine. Similarly, COVID-19 also has its effect on education,
                                  especially on the educational system of non-developed and
                                  developing countries. All the educational institutions of India
                                  are still closed from middle of the March 2020. Some educational
                                  institutions have come forward to offer online classes to reach
                                  the learners remotely to redress the disruption of education. We
                                  are about six months into the COVID-19 outbreak. This
                                  epidemic has led to more than 11 million cases in which more
                                  than 6 Lakh (approx.) people have died. More than 200
                                  countries have been affected with major outbreaks in USA,
                                  Brazil, Russia, Spain, Italy, UK, and also India etc.(Khanna, et
                                  al., 2020).  On 30 th  January 2020, the WHO declared the
                                  epidemic as a global health emergency (WHO, 2020). The
                                  World is passing through a very serious condition. We can see
                                  the calamity of COVID-19 has left a remarkable impact. The
                                  whole education system of India is in a great trouble. Every
                                  aspect of our education system, like-daily class, teaching-
                                  learning, examination, admission and also the administration
                                  system are greatly hampered by this peril. In the following part

                                  the author wants to discuss various problems faced by PG
                                  students during the COVID-19.
                                    2. Problems faced by PG  Students’  during COVID-19:
                                    In this century the advancement of ICT is at its pinnacle.
                                  Nowadays we by and large use technology to enhance our
                                  capacity and also to rejuvenate higher education. So in mid-
                                  2020 when lockdown was announced, all Universities responded
                                  to the situation in a tech savvy way through the help of online
                                  classes. However, initially students faced several problems to
                                  switch over to online modules and e-resources.
                                    Let us take those issues into account:

                                    A. Deficiency in Attention: -
                                    Since all students went back to their houses and facilities of
                                  movement and hobnobbing were highly restricted, so a kind of
                                  stress and fear psychosis had combined to reduce their power
                                  of concentration. We know that attention is one of the key
                                  factors in education but the crisis situation put every student in
                                  an ambience which was not at all conducive for study and
                                  research. In the situation of lockdown and quarantine, homes
                                  became prison-like and joyful mindset was lost that took its toll
                                  on concentration to study.

                                    B. Misuse of social media: -
                                    Since most of the students are detached from conventional
                                  mode of study due to Covid-19 pandemic, they have no
                                  constraint to engage in social media like face book, what’s app,
                                  YouTube and similar others entertainment platforms.
                                    C. Unaffordable technological devices: -
                                    In India many students belong to poor socio-economic
                                  background. Hence most of the students do not possess proper
                                  technological devices required to attend various types of online
                                  classes. The technological devices like – mobile, computer,

                                  laptop, tabs etc. are too expensive to be afforded by most of the
                                  economically weaker students.
                                    D. Deficiency of proper  guideline: -
                                    Every educational system needs proper guidelines to carry
                                  on the system for both teachers and students. But in this
                                  pandemic situation when the whole teaching-learning process
                                  depends on online mode, there has been no proper guideline to
                                  regulate teaching-learning process through online classes. Some
                                  guidelines are must for this type of educational system because
                                  all students are not efficient with computer or mobile devices.
                                  Besides, accountability of teachers regarding online classes
                                  also needs to be ensured.

                                    E. One way learning process: -
                                    We know that education is a bi-polar process but in this
                                  online education system education turn into one way. In this
                                  online education system teachers are the only diligent person
                                  and students are inactive listener. Due to this student can’t
                                  express their creativity through online education.

                                    F. Connection problem: -
                                    When students join online classes, they face an umpteen
                                  technical issues like slow network connection, unclear audio
                                  sounds etc. Thus smooth understanding of students often gets
                                  obstructed.
                                    G. Unable to take and give feedback: -
                                    Feedback is the core factor of learner’s learning evaluation.
                                  Through online classes, students are not being able to clarify
                                  their doubts about the subject being taught and also teachers
                                  are not able to take feedback from his students. Hence, teachers
                                  hardly get to know the progress of their students.

                                    H. Fear of indemnity/ safety: -



                                                                                     423]]></page><page Index="425"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                    There are some misconceptions about our online platform
                                  which universities are using for online classes.
                                    I. Uncertainty about exam: -
                                    In this epidemic situation all universities postponed their
                                  exams. Some of the universities are canceling their exams and
                                  decided that exam numbers are given based on the average
                                  score obtained in previous examination. In that case when no
                                  exam is held, students do not feel any compulsion about their
                                  learning. Therefore, students are gradually detached from the
                                  environment of education.
                                    J. Mental instability: -
                                    In present situation of higher education most of the students
                                  come to live in vicinity with their educational institutions.  But
                                  during lockdown these students are totally disconnected from
                                  their families or even if they manage to go back to their homes,
                                  their movement becomes restricted. Therefore, some mental
                                  instability is created in their psyches and they do not feel
                                  excited about their learning.

                                    K. Financial problems of students: -
                                    Many private or self-finance universities are claimed their
                                  student academic fees. But during this lockdown all students
                                  have not sufficient money to pay the academic fees because all
                                  works are suddenly stopped so their family income is not so
                                  much to afford these types of academic fees. In that case
                                  students are suffering mental stress which is indirectly affected
                                  their learning.

                                    L. Anxiety about future: -
                                    Students grew apprehensive as the situation. They thought
                                  that during the span of lockdown economic conditions of the
                                  country were gradually deteriorating, so may be in future no
                                  government job or vacancy would be available. Such
                                  apprehension created annoyance about their learning.
                                    M. Practical work-related problem: -

                                  424]]></page><page Index="426"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                    Students of science and technical streams were not able to
                                  conduct their practical work with their teachers. We know that
                                  practical works are not completely effective by gaining
                                  theoretical knowledge, it also needs to be practice by our own
                                  hand through right way but through online education it is not
                                  possible at all. Although some students have done their practical
                                  work at home but their work is actually success or not, they
                                  can’t evaluate it.
                                    N. Detached from library facility: -

                                    Books are the most important inputs of education to the
                                  members of any academic community. All universities have
                                  own libraries although this library facility may not serve
                                  students’ interest optimally unless digitalization in the form of
                                  e-books, e-journals are made available. Hence, when libraries
                                  were closed its services were obviously disrupted except in
                                  those few cases where professionally committed library
                                  personnel responded with initiatives to extend e-facility for
                                  their readers.

                                    O. Detached from Co-curricular  activities: -
                                    We know that education is not confined to books or textual
                                  knowledge but it is the process of all round development of the
                                  student. Every university has some co-curricular activities to
                                  encourage this process. But during the pandemic situation all
                                  students are detached from these co-curricular activities.

                                    P. Lack of positive attitude of the institute: -
                                    Although Universities are assuredly providing online classes
                                  but there are some gaps in that work. Hence the students of
                                  these universities may bear the brunt of such critical gaps in the
                                  delivery of education.

                                    Q. Deficiency of proper  planning: -
                                    In the present time universities are trying to communicate
                                  and educate students through various types of online methods



                                                                                     425]]></page><page Index="427"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  but these methods are implemented without proper planning.
                                  Hence it creates many problems to students like
                                    l Time of the classes are unknown by the students; classes
                                       are held unconventionally.
                                    l There are no proper guidelines for attaint online classes.
                                    l If the class was missed by the students how they are
                                       getting that previous class, they don’t know etc.
                                    R. Teachers related problems: -
                                    As all students are unable to join online classes, similarly all
                                  teachers are not properly equipped to take online classes.
                                  Hence during this lockdown teaching in different subjects vary
                                  widely which is a drawback of the online mode. We all know
                                  that students’  learning is indirectly affected by our teacher’s
                                  personality but due to this pandemic situation the absence of
                                  teacher or recorded video of a lecture cannot be expected to be
                                  equally motivating for the students as compared to the physical
                                  mode of teaching learning.
                                    S. Feel isolates and hesitates: -

                                    We know that education is not only confined in the class
                                  room but also it is an interaction between the components of
                                  the education. This environment creates the student’s personality.
                                  In this environment students are frequently discussing their
                                  knowledge with each other and it helps a lot to their learning.
                                  As that time online classes are cannot create this environment
                                  so those students are feeling isolated at home. As it is a new
                                  process and also new teaching method for regular students so
                                  that many of the students are not comfortable with it. They feel
                                  hesitate to grab online education.
                                    3. Probable solutions:
                                    Often the seed of solution is hidden in the womb of the
                                  problem itself. It is a very common human nature that we
                                  always want to overcome such circumstances with great effort.


                                  426]]></page><page Index="428"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  Having said so, it is our duty to think of probable path to
                                  overcome the above-mentioned problems in following ways:
                                    A. Demonstration of joining online class:
                                    Wherein every student is joining online classes, we can
                                  create a full demonstration video of the online platform which
                                  is used by the universities for online class. With the help of
                                  this, students can use the online platform easily.
                                    B. New online platform:
                                    In the present time to remove the problems related to online
                                  platforms, we can create some new online educational platforms
                                  which are user-friendly, cheaper and more flexible than present
                                  online platforms. For this purpose we can take help from
                                  different types of learning apps like Byju’s etc.
                                    C. Good mental health building:
                                    Firstly, we need to give a right and practical outlook of this
                                  situation to our students and eliminate the fear lying underneath
                                  our minds. We can supply scientific knowledge through FM
                                  radio, TV  channels, and social media also.
                                    D. Education through social media:
                                    As many students are attracted to social media and most of
                                  them are capable to frequently use these, so, in this lockdown
                                  situation we can conduct our education through social media.
                                  It will be joyful and encouraging participation of students in the
                                  curriculum transaction also.

                                    E. Online unit test:
                                    We can conduct some small online exams or unit tests to
                                  boost up activeness of students. We know that online evaluation
                                  is not so much appropriate but some small tests could bring
                                  continuity in education during this difficult time.

                                    F. Giving Homework:
                                    Teachers can give some study related work, so that students
                                  do not waste time in entertainment. Of course, the result has to

                                                                                     427]]></page><page Index="429"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  be determined later by those works; otherwise, their mind will
                                  not settle.
                                    G. Economic support:
                                    The Private or self-finance universities should be reducing
                                  their academic fees and give some rescission for poor students.
                                  Further Government can give some educational scholarship for
                                  poor students to maintain their education at this time.
                                    H. Open E-library:
                                    Every university can be encouraged to offer an E-Library to
                                  solve book related problems where all students have their own
                                  User Id with limited time period. Such initiatives will be in
                                  sync with e-study where hundreds of e-books for students
                                  would be available and the service will be available at home.
                                  This can supplement online courses that can be done by the
                                  interested persons on their own apart from webinars and online
                                  workshops, which may unfurl a new horizon of knowledge
                                  experience and intellectual fruition for the college and university
                                  students and faculties to add credit to their career prospect.

                                    I. Evaluate of practical work: -
                                    For evaluating the practical works of students, we suggest
                                  that they record their works and send that recorded item to their
                                  teachers for feedback. Teachers will then discuss the mistakes
                                  with their students. In this way students can get their works
                                  evaluated although it may take time. But this type of alternative
                                  idea could motivate students at this time.

                                    J. Some Co-curricular  Activities at Home:
                                    Students would be enthused if they find scope to involve
                                  themselves in various co-curricular activities along with home
                                  assignment. During the lockdown situation, it is very important
                                  to get rid to monotony. Along with studies their mental and
                                  physical fatigue can be removed through performance of co-
                                  curricular activities at home.
                                    K. Engage the students in online teamwork: -

                                    In present situation of competition and evaluation system
                                  based on individual scores, students are often reluctant to
                                  engage in teamwork, except certain compulsions. As a result,
                                  they are not able to discuss their works with each other and
                                  cannot implement their thoughts with confidence or consensus.
                                  This loss of their confidence often becomes a cause to suffer
                                  from depression. As a solution to this problem, we can give
                                  them the opportunity of teamwork through online. It may be in
                                  the form of engaging them to collect data for a collaborative
                                  research enterprise in higher education. The teacher concerned
                                  may give them a particular time to discuss the problems related
                                  their works where one student of that team or group shares the
                                  problems with teacher and his classmates to get probable
                                  solutions.
                                    Conclusion:
                                    At the end we can say that many problems or situations
                                  came to obstruct our education, but we have to overcome from
                                  it. Actually, the broader meaning of education is to adjust with
                                  every problematic situation. On the other hand, one of the
                                  characteristics of humanity is to become acquainted with
                                  innovation and adopt it. The present age is the age of technology.
                                  Along with other daily activities technology is spreading in the
                                  field of education. We should master various techniques of
                                  technology and apply them properly. Without the proper use of
                                  technology, we fail to protect our education system from
                                  current curse. Delivering quality education to students through
                                  new online platforms is the only viable solution available at
                                  present.
                                    From the above discussion, it is clear that the COVID-19
                                  pandemic has left a dent on our conventional education system.
                                  Hence we perceive that the need of the hour is to diffuse the
                                  mental problems at this time with the healing touch of books
                                  and online edutainment staff. However, we appreciate that
                                  imparting education via virtual classroom can’t be a substitute
                                  of real classroom. We know that education is the backbone of

                                                                                     429]]></page><page Index="431"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  education. Hence while on one hand we need to fight with the
                                  pandemic, on the other hand, it is our solemn duty to rejuvenate
                                  education with intelligent planning of our educational road

                                  Abstract
                                  The Coronavirus interrupted our daily lives including formal
                                  schooling. It led to the imposition of lockdown and put
                                  everything to a daunting test by interfering with our ordinary
                                  lives in ongoing history. With an objective to conquer the
                                  impact of the pandemic, schools from one side of the planet to
                                  the other were changing to web-based instructional mode.
                                  Mixed learning with advanced methodologies was prescribed
                                  for the impending training framework. The critical need of the
                                  hour was to remain protected at home. The educators however
                                  were not sitting idle but rather they were attempting to adjust
                                  and come to terms with the change through virtual classes. In
                                  this paper the investigator has explained the effectiveness of
                                  virtual classes and online examinations during the difficult
                                  hours of Covid-19 situation. The author witnessed the Covid
                                  situation, hence during the work of writing this paper the
                                  researcher put her own experiences and sought to explore the
                                  challenges and problems associated with the pandemic situation.
                                  Finally, the researcher indicated that the Covid-19 pandemic
                                  created new horizon of online learning although online learning
                                  was beset with many limitations.

                                    With the startling COVID-19 pandemic, schools all
                                  throughout the planet have made a stride to assist with advancing
                                  social separation in the expectation of easing back the spread
                                  of the infection. Nonetheless, the progress to web based
                                  learning could be quite difficult for everybody. To propel the
                                  online classes, educators are investigating every possibility to
                                  guarantee euphoria, warmth, and humor while video
                                  conferencing with the understudies. Mrs Nidhi Bansal, Pro-
                                  Vice Chairperson, Pacific World School, said, “This progress to
                                  the virtual mode is a result of the cooperative endeavors of the
                                  school’s executives, instructors, understudies, and guardians.
                                  Careful arranging, continuous parent-educator interface by means
                                  of WhatsApp, dependence on online assets and above all, the
                                  student’s energetic association is without a doubt motivating
                                  components in the coordinated effort” (Bansal, 2020)

                                     1.1 Virtual Classroom
                                    What is a virtual classroom? A virtual classroom is not quite
                                  the same as the customary study hall; in a virtual class; there
                                  is an instructor who is instructing yet not in the class but rather
                                  before a camera of a PC at some place, and studies partake in
                                  his group sitting in their rooms before the PC. In the virtual
                                  study halls there can be an intelligent meeting like a customary
                                  homeroom, understudies and educators can collaborate. Virtual
                                  Classroom can be characterized as “A collaborative web
                                  conferencing tool with an online white board, breakout rooms,
                                  and screen sharing capabilities, for teachers and tutors who
                                  want to conduct highly interactive live online teaching sessions.”

                                    Benefits of Virtual Classroom (VC)
                                     1. VCs are more useful for the understudies who can’t go
                                  to the schools or school consistently.
                                    2. It gives a benefit for the understudy to go to classes from

                                    3. It likewise lessens the study hall fear of understudies.
                                    4. VC is the customized learning; understudies can learn at
                                  their will.
                                    5. It gives understudies and educators an overall openness.

                                    7. In the case of having fundamental hardware, it would
                                  give an amazing chance to the understudies from the distant
                                  towns and regions.
                                    8. It gives access from anyplace on the planet, any time

                                    2. It is additionally censured for hindering the exchange of
                                  free thought as we do in real classroom and might further
                                  encourage online contents to be presented in distorted form.

                                    However there is no substitution to coordinate human
                                  cooperation for a smooth change from the customary classes
                                  via the instrumentality of virtual classes. Online courses appeal

                                  Pallavi Uphadhyaya, Principal, DPS Rajnagar Extension said,
                                  “The video cooperation has given an edge to the whole learning
                                  framework, it has caused understudies to investigate additional
                                  learning stages and execute thoughts that they have never
                                  attempted. The lockdown circumstance would have demonstrated
                                  to be exceptionally exhausting had there been no E-learning for
                                  these youthful personalities. Going to online classes is loose
                                  and accompanies the solace of homes. This is likewise mirroring
                                  a positive effect on their participation” ( http://
                                  www.thepressindia.i, 2020).
                                    2. Virtual Teaching:
                                    The students and teachers can communicate and share
                                  knowledge through mail, online chat and video conferences.
                                  But in the classroom they can communicate through a single
                                  channel only. Nowadays many students are very much interested
                                  in learning through online mode rather than coming to class
                                  physically. During this Lockdown period, it has become
                                  mandatory to close educational institutions. This mode of
                                  online classes is more preferred by students because there
                                  would be more freedom from offline classroom discipline
                                  which means more flexibility and comfort in learning. But
                                  when we consider the Teacher - Student relationship, it is much
                                  less cemented when compared to real classes. Interaction
                                  between Teacher and student becomes less and the students feel
                                  reluctant in asking questions in online classes. Such types of
                                  online classes can be opted only when it is essential for any
                                  emergency situation and not during all times.

                                    2.1 A  Virtual Classroom Better  Than A  Real One

                                  to another side. The new styles adopted for learning have

                                  is really a big challenge we face. During these online classes
                                  students can study in a flexible manner. Rather than setting up
                                  their lives through traditional learning, this online mode of
                                  learning allows students to put and fit education into their lives.
                                  In online classes, students have a chance to take a break at
                                  certain times. They can even listen to classes while travelling
                                  in a bus or taking lunch which is quite impossible in traditional
                                  classrooms.
                                    2.3 Knowledge Retention

                                  of fun and interactive sessions of modules which may be
                                  paused and repeated whenever required in online classrooms.

                                  really obvious there’s numerous approaches to interface with
                                  virtual study halls. You can message your educator through talk

                                  conventional architecture. Thus a new set up can open up
                                  affordable benefits if academia and industry or civil society
                                  groups take some initiatives to help pull resources like hi-tech
                                  teaching and research aids through partnership and MoUs.
                                    Immediate input on tests and tests

                                    A virtual Classroom gives the benefit of getting immediate
                                  inputs like criticism on the tests and tests which are held. An
                                  individual doesn’t need to hang tight for the outcomes for quite
                                  a long time or weeks to get the scores on the off chance that
                                  he/she is selected for an online degree program. It helps the
                                  educators as they don’t need to trust that the time span will get
                                  over after the tests/tests are held, they can continue with their
                                  schedule immediately. The tests, tasks or tests are typically
                                  scored when the student wraps up. These aides in progress
                                  following the understudy and the frail regions for development
                                  are additionally shown.

                                    5. Virtual Classroom Project
                                    A  Virtual Classroom Project is a piece of the distance
                                  learning which normally consolidates course materials,
                                  schoolwork, tests, appraisals, and different instruments that are
                                  for the most part outer to the study hall experience. Under the
                                  idea of a virtual class project, the undertakings and tasks are
                                  held essentially and the outcomes are proclaimed simultaneously.
                                  This idea is time and energy saving as one doesn’t need to trust
                                  that the work first will be checked for continuing with the
                                  schedule forward.

                                    6. Virtual Training
                                    Virtual Training implies the preparation which is done as a
                                  strategy fit for world-wide virtual climate, or when the areas of
                                  the student and educators need sophisticated training with the
                                  help of virtual space that are intended for formulating appropriate
                                  training modules. Virtual preparation should be to supplement
                                  conditions intended to cater to the need of sophisticated learning


                                                                                     439]]></page><page Index="441"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  experience.  It is important for a bigger preparation stage like
                                  virtual ground which amplifies the learning environment.
                                    Conclusion
                                    It follows from the discussion that the pandemic acted like
                                  a boon in disguise behind a very quick shift from direct to
                                  digital mode of teaching-learning and research and lockdown
                                  forced the stakeholders for initiating dialogues through webinars
                                  for better learning outcome. However questions abound
                                  regarding the extent of viability or efficacy of the online mode
                                  and its various aspects. Similarly, the question was how far we
                                  were ready for the shift given widespread disparity in society
                                  and variegated background of our students. Also one may
                                  pertinently ask question relating to our exposure to information
                                  explosion or how far the overload of information could really
                                  help the young learners. Yet there is no gainsaying the fact that
                                  unless the state and civil society organizations come together
                                  with liberal support and consensus, mere policy thrust to
                                  popularize online education and giving education more hi-tech
                                  orientation will remain inadequate for the coveted objective
                                  that we wish to achieve and accomplish. It does not mean to
                                  say that learning through online mode is less effective in our
                                  study but web-based interactions can also inspire students
                                  provided devices like large screen, internet platform like Google
                                  Meet are made available across geographical regions which
                                  needs huge investment and proactive management of equity
                                  issue for underprivileged children. Today when normal schools
                                  are re-opening we need to take lessons of the pandemic period
                                  so that delivery of education cannot go back to earlier centralized
                                  mode. The instructors are likewise encouraged to explore
                                  inventiveness, acquire novel abilities, utilize yoga as an input
                                  to draw inspiration from and as a habit to inculcate healthy,
                                  open and sustainable education in the post-pandemic context.

                                  Abstract: With the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic there has
                                  been major impact in the livelihood of the people engaged in
                                  various sectors. In this article, we will be discussing about the
                                  impact of the novel coronavirus disease in education and in the
                                  service sector and the major positive and negative trends in
                                  those sectors due to the pandemic. The current worldwide
                                  epidemic has wreaked disturbance on one of the foremost vital
                                  systems: education. Education is undeniably crucial in
                                  contributing to a country’s welfare and social development.
                                  However it is endangered by the rapid spread of the COVID -
                                  19. It had an enormous impact on the lives of children
                                  especially those belonging to vulnerable groups. Their rights to
                                  education were severely affected since the lockdown was
                                  enforced and it triggered a series of adverse effects including
                                  closure induced huge retrenchment and migration in unorganized
                                  sectors. However, the initial trend of suffering took some time
                                  to shift to work-from-home model which became successful to
                                  some extent and it helped companies to cope up with the
                                  hardships caused by the pandemic.

                                    The Impact of Covid-19 on Education and Service Sectors
                                    The COVID-19 pandemic that originated within the town of
                                  urban center of China has quickly spread to many countries
                                  around the world. As per reports, in the year of 2020, 56,342
                                  positive cases were registered in India, with a population of
                                  over 1.34 billion-the second largest population within the
                                  world. Multiple ways of modeling, applied math tools, and
                                  quantitative analysis would be extremely necessary to handle
                                  this outbreak. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of
                                  India has raised awareness concerning the recent occurrence,
                                  its possible relapse and also it has taken necessary actions to
                                  combat the impact of COVID-19. The central and state
                                  governments are taking many measures and formulating many
                                  protocols to realize this goal. Moreover, the Indian government
                                  enforced a 55-days lockdown throughout the country that
                                  started on March twenty fifth, 2020, to scale down the
                                  transmission of the virus. This occurrence is inextricably
                                  connected to the economy of the state, because it has
                                  dramatically obstructed industrial sectors and supply chain as a
                                  result of repulsive shock and cautious approach concerning
                                  partaking in business within the affected regions. However,
                                  with the gradual development of vaccines like Covaxin,
                                  Covishield, etc. the cases have gone down to some extent
                                  although a specter of its bouncing back cannot be ruled out.
                                  With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic there has been
                                  major impact in the livelihood of the people engaged in various
                                  sectors. In this article, we will be discussing about the major
                                  impact of the novel coronavirus disease in education and the
                                  service sectors and the major positive and negative outcomes in
                                  those sectors.
                                    The current worldwide epidemic has wreaked disturbance

                                  is endangered by the rapid spread of COVID -19. It had an
                                  enormous impact on the lives of children especially those
                                  belonging to vulnerable groups. Their rights to education were
                                  severely affected since the lockdown was enforced and it
                                  triggered a series of adverse effects. Education was hampered
                                  by the financial stress that reduced overall productivity and
                                  output. Also, the problem of unemployment rose alarmingly
                                  during this period.

                                    In March 2020, a nationwide lockdown was implemented,
                                  forcing some colleges and schools to shut down and instruction
                                  for the students was to switch over to online classroom learning
                                  style. This resulted in an overnight shift whereby information
                                  technology enabled online learning came into existence. Classes
                                  began to be conducted online over Microsoft Teams or Zoom
                                  or other various virtual meeting platforms. As many teachers,
                                  faculties and also students were not accustomed to the e-
                                  learning and virtual meeting platforms, initially they faced a lot
                                  of issues; hence they required primary training on how to use
                                  the appropriate technological tools so that education of the
                                  students does not get affected due to the pandemic. The
                                  evolution of online learning initially created problems but later
                                  it proved to be a boon for children at large. E-learning saves
                                  lots of time and efforts that gets invested on travelling to
                                  schools and colleges. Students find more time to study and it
                                  enhances their skills and knowledge at home.
                                    However, due to inadequate infrastructure, productivity
                                  suffered. Remote learning wasn’t accessible in each family
                                  especially at remote rural pockets. As per Global internet
                                  network research, only 24% of the families had proper internet
                                  connectivity whereas different remote areas remained
                                  unapproachable. As a result, the government was forced to
                                  assure that sufficient benefits and financial help would be
                                  provided.
                                    The technology and the IT industry in India have been
                                  known always for its great, innovative experiments and its

                                  it stood for one factor specifically its folks and therefore the
                                  resonating message from nearly each CEO was regarding the
                                  security and health of their workers and their families. Almost
                                  every company has been very much concerned about the safety
                                  of their employees and their families and worked as a family
                                  and stood beside each other in these tough times. The companies
                                  are making great efforts to provide 24×7 support to employees
                                  like testing, information, doctors on call, isolation centers,
                                  oxygen concentrators, insurance, mental wellness, partnership
                                  with healthcare providers and vaccination drives such that their
                                  physical and mental wellness is not affected.
                                    With the outbreak of pandemic, almost every business had
                                  speedily transitioned to a remote operating model or work from
                                  home model in the various IT companies whereas keeping
                                  worker’s safety in the mind as its foremost priority. Initially
                                  businesses have suffered huge financial loss and also it took
                                  time to shift to work from home model but their efforts in
                                  making work from home model successful and executing
                                  effectively helped companies cope up with the hardships caused
                                  by the pandemic. Over the last fourteen months, various
                                  companies have endlessly worked in strengthening the remote
                                  operating model and nearly everything is virtual like hiring, on
                                  boarding, sales, collaboration, delivery and even M&A. The
                                  various IT companies have designed best practices on how to
                                  operate remotely from home effectively and due to the constant
                                  efforts in the innovation in working remotely even lockdowns
                                  did not led any hardships. Almost all firms were at 90% work
                                  from home model in March 2021 and have quickly transitioned
                                  to 98% work from home. The model is very compatible and
                                  constant efforts are being made in the field of technology and
                                  infrastructure for the successful operation of the work from
                                  home model. Work from home model adopted by the various
                                  companies has been greatly advantageous for the companies as
                                  well as for their employees. People now are able to spend more

                                  The essentiality of online platform is growing day by day in
                                  education sector as well as in different other sectors of our life.
                                  It is quite evident when the COVID-19 pandemic situation is
                                  prevailing. The present study was conducted to find out the
                                  attitude of post graduate students towards online learning in
                                  Purulia district of West Bengal. For this study, we have used to
                                  collect data by a self-made closed questionnaire with 5-point
                                  Likert scale from 87 postgraduate level students with the help
                                  of simple random sampling and the outcome shows that there
                                  are lots of challenges and opportunities in the process of

                                    1.0 Introduction

                                    Online learning is beneficial for the teachers to provide the
                                  students with more technologically advanced learning and for
                                  the students as they can learn from digital tools more
                                  conveniently. In West Bengal, in the wake of COVID-19
                                  maximum number of school, colleges and universities have
                                  adopted the approach of education 4.0, which is a part of
                                  industry 4.0, to continue the classes for the students and to
                                  mitigate the issues concerning education and the barriers imposed
                                  by the pandemic in the academic processes of the students
                                  (Kapasia et al., 2020). However there are also some problems
                                  of online learning which are faced by the teachers as well as
                                  students as every individual is not accustomed to the use of
                                  technology and digital tools (Siau, Xi & Zou, 2019).Moreover,
                                  the students in the rural regions face the most issues as some
                                  of them, due to financial instability, are unable to take advantage
                                  of technology for their higher education.
                                    The education sector has evolved over the years after the
                                  first industrial revolution occurred. After digital space advanced,
                                  technological aspects became significant in the education system,
                                  which involved Artificial Intelligence (AI), the internet, robotics
                                  and big data (Hariharasudan & Kot, 2018).The application of
                                  online learning which is a part education 4.0 has become
                                  important as it provides a practical approach towards learning
                                  innovation with the use of technology and information in its
                                  procedures.
                                    Online education or e-learning is an education system where
                                  we teach and learn by the use of internet (Mandal & Das,
                                  2021). It refers a systematic process where we take any course
                                  any degree or participating in any other educational endeavour
                                  through the internet (Ashley friedman, 2019).
                                    Attitude of a person refers a feeling or way of thinking that
                                  affects a person’s behaviour. It helps to find the nature of
                                  personality. Attitude may positive or negative, depends
                                  individually on particular situation.

                                    1.1 Objectives of the study

                                    The objectives of this study are as follows
                                    *To understand the aspects of online teaching learning
                                  process with respect to post-graduate students in their higher
                                  education.
                                    * To analyze the challenges related to online learning which
                                  are faced in the higher education system of Purulia, West
                                  Bengal.
                                    * To evaluate the opportunities of post-graduation students
                                  in higher education systems due to online platform.
                                    1.2 Literature Review
                                    Dwivedi & Joshi (2019) stated that after the advent of
                                  education 4.0, the students are able to learn about their courses
                                  and subjects from the practical based learning method instead
                                  of traditional techniques or theoretical based knowledge. The
                                  skill and intelligence of the students are enhanced when they
                                  are able to gain understanding from project base learning. In
                                  addition, the student can also compete in the digitally driven
                                  atmosphere due to the use of digital tools for their education.
                                    Sadhu & Gide (2019) mentioned that there are specific
                                  issues that the internet of things has bought about, especially in
                                  the higher education system. One of the most prominent issues
                                  is that educators are needed to meet the expectations and needs
                                  of digital communities. The students also have to be under
                                  pressure due to high competition in the education sector as they
                                  have to prepare for the jobs that can impact the world shortly.
                                  The education procedures have become challenging due to this
                                  particular reason.
                                    Mondal & Das (2021) discussed that attitude of urban
                                  students towards online learning are different from rural areas
                                  students and they have more positive attitude as compared to
                                  rural students. Here, there is a huge need to take positive steps

                                  about the process of online teaching learning at rural
                                  areas from the government. Hence, both students from the
                                  urban areas as well as the rural areas will progress by hand to
                                  hand.

                                    Konwar (2017) mentioned that the students who have taken
                                  more education through e-learning process got more marks
                                  from the students who have taken less education from online
                                  strategy and students are ready to take all the benefit from
                                  online in their study. We have to focus on all the aspects of
                                  online teaching learning environment. So, students will stay
                                  with this attitude during long period of time.
                                    Singh (2021) focused that Gender plays no role on the
                                  students’ attitude towards online teaching-learning process.
                                  Although, male students have a little bit positive attitude
                                  compared to female students. We need to keep this in mind
                                  during online class to get equal benefits to all the students from
                                  the learning materials.
                                    2.0 Delimitation of the study

                                    The delimitation of this research is that only the students in
                                  their post-graduation course and only those who belong to
                                  Purulia, West Bengal, have been selected for the survey and we
                                  used a closed-ended questionnaire for this study.

                                    3.0 Methodology:
                                    The present study aims to find out the attitudes of
                                  postgraduate students towards online learning. So, we use
                                  descriptive survey research method. It is used for inquiry and
                                  collection of the data to study the relation between information
                                  and communication technology and education.

                                    3.1 Sample and Sampling Technique
                                    A  number of 87 students of Purulia district from different
                                  universities are selected with the help of simple random sampling
                                  technique for this study.


                                                                                     451]]></page><page Index="453"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                    3.2 Tools Used

                                    A self-structured closed questionnaire containing 13 questions
                                  is used for collecting data and secondary sources like books,
                                  magazines, journals, etc. are used to gather the needed
                                  information.
                                    4.0 Analysis and Interpretation of Data
                                    We have collected the responses of the questionnaire from
                                  the university students in online mode via Google Form. This
                                  questionnaire with thirteen questions was given via social
                                  media for a period of two weeks. After receiving the responses,
                                  we carried out the analysis and are presented below.

                                    1.1 Online learning is more effective than conventional
                                  learning
                                    The responses of this question are given in Table 1 and also
                                  in Figure 1. Table 1 reflects the responses of the statement
                                  “Online learning is more effective than conventional learning”.
                                    Table1: Online learning is more effective than conventional
                                  learning

                                                    Agree                        Disagree
                                  Online learning is  4.6%  25.3%  2.3%    54%   13.8%
                                  more effective than
                                  conventional learning
                                    It is observed that 54% pupils disagree with this statement
                                  while 13.8% pupils strongly disagree.  Also, 25.3% pupils
                                  agree and 4.6% strongly agree with it and 2.3% pupils are
                                  undecided. So, we can derive the conclusion that majority of
                                  people are taking side at non acceptance of online mode while
                                  we face lots of problem to take education without electronic
                                  media.

                                  relationship between student and teacher
                                    This enquiry has taken the responses in its support because
                                  majority of the students agreed with it and it is clear from the
                                  table 2 and figure 2.

                                  interpersonal
                                  relationship between
                                  student and teacher
                                    Table 2 and Figure 2 reflect the responses of the statement
                                  “Online teaching learning degrades interpersonal relationship
                                  between student and teacher”. Here recorded responses show
                                  17.2%, 0.05%, 6.9%, 60.95% and 14.9% pupils disagree,
                                  strongly disagree, undecided, agree and strongly agree
                                  respectively with it. So, we can derive that the relationship
                                  among teachers and students in online process shows weaker
                                  than traditional classroom or conventional approach of education.

                                  statement “The teacher does not give equal importance to all
                                  the students while teaching online”.  In this statement 24.1%
                                  pupils disagree, 8% pupils strongly disagree, 18.4% pupils are
                                  undecided, 37.9% pupils agree, 11.5% pupils strongly agree.
                                  We see that around 50% of the sample agrees with it. So, we
                                  can conclude that teachers are unable to accord same importance
                                  to all the pupils. It increases the distance among teacher and his
                                  students and affects badly learning of students and their outcome.

                                  from different difficulties during online class due to lack of
                                  internet availability.

                                  utilization of education due to economic condition of their

                                  agree and 6.9% pupils strongly agree with this statement. So,
                                  we can conclude that students are comfortable with the
                                  conventional leaning materials rather than the online materials.
                                  It is clear that we have to focus very much for making teaching
                                  learning materials in online platform. So, pupils are interested
                                  to read internet materials.

                                  online is much easy than paper pencil test. We can say that it
                                  takes less time to evaluation performance of the students
                                  through online education process.

                                  traditional education

                                  31 % can’t decide and near about 19% disagree with the
                                  statement. Table shows that almost 50% of the students agree
                                  with the statement. We can say that online teaching learning
                                  process should be encouraged to continue with the physical
                                  classroom experience of students so that in future students can
                                  learn better of online material and its process.

                                  derive that the beginning time and its duration should be set
                                  based on the nature of subject. On the other side in traditional
                                  classroom, there may be late to enter into the classroom to
                                  teacher or students and it creates less problem to students to
                                  understand the topic. There is a scope to overcome the problems
                                  by the teacher or the peer but in online platform there is no
                                  chance to overcome the problem with past lesson, whole class

                                  there must be an appropriate time of online class.

                                    5.0 Findings
                                    After the analysis of the responses described above, the
                                  major findings of this study are as follows:

                                       i. In spite of the widespread initiation of online education
                                         the students of Purulia, still desire the conventional
                                         method of teaching learning.
                                      ii. Various sorts of disparities are being observed in the
                                         relationship between teachers and students.
                                      iii. Due to various obstacle of network teachers are unable
                                         to pay equal importance to all of his pupils.

                                      iv. Most of the remote villages are deprived of strong
                                         mobile network that is account for the poor online
                                         teaching learning.
                                      v. Opportunities of exploring the endowment among pupils
                                         are increasing accordingly as they are participating
                                         without any hesitation on their discussion of study
                                         materials.
                                      vi. Multiple sorts of lacuna in the development of the
                                         learners’ personality are being clearly observed.

                                     vii. Students are able to understand the proper method of
                                         actual curriculum of online platform with juxtaposition
                                         of traditional learning and online learning process.
                                    6.0 Conclusion and Suggestions
                                    On the basis of above analysis and discussion we conclude
                                  that right education at right time makes all round development
                                  of a student and it grows the whole country day by day.
                                  Looking the challenges and opportunities towards online learning
                                  among post-graduation students, we can derive that there is
                                  ample scope to change the negative attitudes into positive
                                  attitude to all round development of the students.
                                    Maximum utilization of education is feasible only when we
                                  can connect our education process properly with the internet. It
                                  has been seen that maximum people belong to rural areas in
                                  Purulia district. Education is not reaching at the desired rate to
                                  the students of remote area of this district and they do not know
                                  the suitable use of internet. So, we have to focus more on
                                  education system in rural areas to progress the district.

                                  disciplines. The traditional education system has been replaced
                                  by modern education system. Now-a-days modern tools and
                                  techniques are widely used in education system. Today education
                                  has to cater to vast area, and the classroom teaching was
                                  considered more effective. The Ministry of Human Resource
                                  Development (MHRD) has introduced different modes of
                                  teaching like direct teaching, face to face mode, open learning
                                  system, etc. The face to face method is very cost-effective and
                                  time-consuming. Since 2000s changes are taking place through
                                  the introduction of e-learning and open learning by increasing
                                  online appearance and digitalized learning opportunities. Now,
                                  the government is emphasizing massive open online courses

                                  launched a brand new platform of Massive Open Online
                                  Courses (MOOCs) called SWAYAM. The Government of India
                                  has also thought of reaching the remote areas through MOOCs
                                  to provide valuable and free education. The study focuses on
                                  measuring the B.Ed. students’ opinion of MOOCs.

                                    Introduction
                                    In the traditional system of education, students usually
                                  learnt through teachers’ instruction or through reading books.
                                  But since the 20 th  century, learning has been taking place in
                                  accordance with learners’ interest, ability and attitude by using
                                  modern technology. The SWAYAM platform is indigenously
                                  developed by MHRD for hosting MOOCs covering school to
                                  postgraduate programmed in all subjects including professional
                                  courses. One thousand massive open online courses are available
                                  by renowned teachers from different reputed institutions. Any
                                  one can learn through mobile or laptop without cost up to 20%
                                  credit transfer facility available for enrolled students. Different
                                  MOOCs platforms have been launched where universities are
                                  hosting their courses with a certificate, some are free platforms.
                                  Now the question arises whether sufficient information is
                                  available about the SWAYAM platform, whether college students
                                  have any idea about this type of portal or courses, and what
                                  kind of opinion they have about MOOCs. This study has been
                                  conducted to emphasize opinion of B.Ed. students on MOOCs.
                                    Related studies
                                    Liyanagunawarendena, et al. (2013) finds out that MOOC
                                  is a recent addition to the range of online learning options.
                                  Since 2008, massive open online course has been run by a
                                  variety of public elite universities. Many academies have taken
                                  interest in MOOCs recognizing the potential to deliver education
                                  around the globe on an unprecedented scale; some of these
                                  academies are taking a research oriented perspective. It is the

                                  first attempt to systematically review literature relating to
                                  MOOCs. The review finds eight categories: introductory, interest,
                                  concept, case studies, educational theory, technology, participant
                                  focussed, provider focussed and other.

                                    Conole (2016) considers the pedagogies associated with
                                  different types of MOOCs which are an online course that
                                  throws challenge on traditional educational institution. It is a
                                  that kind of behavioural learning and online path which plays
                                  an important role in creating mutual interaction between teachers
                                  and students and among other academic colleagues without any
                                  face to face interaction. It focuses on harnessing the power of
                                  social media and interaction with peers, adopting a connectivist
                                  learning approach. The study provides the history of the
                                  emergence of MOOCs and the key stakeholders. It also
                                  introduces alternative means o categorizing MOOCs, basing the
                                  key characteristics. The Cs of learning design will enhance
                                  learner experience and ensure quality assurance.

                                    Martinez et. al (2018) state that most massive open online
                                  courses (MOOCs) use simple schemes for aggregating peer
                                  grades, taking the mean or the median, or compute weights
                                  from information other than the instructor’s opinion about the
                                  students’ knowledge. In order to reduce the difference between
                                  the instructor and students’ aggregated scores, some proposals
                                  compute specific weights to aggregate the peer grades. In this
                                  work, they analyze the use of students’ engagement and
                                  performance measures to compute personalized weights and
                                  study the validity of the aggregated scores produced by these
                                  common functions mean, and median, together with two others
                                  from the information retrieval field, the geometric and harmonic
                                  means.
                                    Baturay (2014)  emphasizes that Massive Open Online
                                  Course (MOOC) is a new concept as well as a new trend of
                                  higher education in recent years. The researcher describes
                                  many dimensions of MOOCs among which the most important

                                    Discussion on the results
                                    The present study shows that both male and female B.Ed.
                                  students acquired almost equal cognitive view about MOOCs.
                                  The difference is there, but it is not significant. It is also found

                                  that there is almost similar view regarding MOOCs among the
                                  rural and urban B.Ed. students. Of course, the difference exists
                                  there, but that is not significant. When we considered the
                                  opinion of arts and science students of B. Ed. regarding
                                  MOOCs, science students acquired more information about
                                  MOOCs than arts students did. It is also indicated that science
                                  students emphasized more on information about MOOCs than
                                  arts students did. The science B.Ed. students have adequate
                                  knowledge about MOOCs than arts students do. The Government
                                  may conduct different types of training programme for the B.
                                  Ed. students and Teachers towards MOOCs. The Students
                                  should get proper guidance regarding the enrolment for any
                                  MOOC.

                                    Conclusion
                                    MOOCs have undoubtedly created an interest as an agent of
                                  change in the field of higher education around the globe. It is
                                  possible to provide quality education in a single platform like
                                  MOOCs. Hence, it is recommended that the teachers should
                                  implement web-based learning in their classroom to teach all
                                  subjects. This process will enable the B. Ed. students to
                                  enhance their learning competency and thus help them to
                                  develop creativity among themselves. MOOCs can develop
                                  knowledge of a student and can develop diversified students’
                                  thinking. Now the teaching-learning process is introduced
                                  through online. It is very easy to access and a systematic path
                                  to enrich knowledge of students.

                                  Abstract:
                                  Indian Education system was broadly offline-based before the
                                  pandemic although online mode was already there in the
                                  delivery system. However, Corona virus endangered many
                                  aspects of our social life including conventional education.
                                  Education system overnight shifted to digital mode with lot of
                                  hiccups in the process. Though the transitions was  in haste but
                                  it taught all of us in teaching learning process that this mode is
                                  going to stay here. Online mode and various E-learning resources
                                  will be integral part of future education. We have realized its
                                  potential in the country like India where accessibility to education
                                  is a burning issue. Now slowly and gradually we have accepted
                                  and implemented blended mode of teaching and learning as a
                                  new path in quality education.

                                    From January 2020 till December 2021 we were swept and
                                  overwhelmed by the spread of corona virus in china; we all


                                                                                     475]]></page><page Index="477"><![CDATA[Online Learning and Research Alternative Dimensions of Covid-19 Pandemic

                                  were talking about it, closely watching on international news
                                  regarding spread of virus and its impact on china and its
                                  people. But hardly we thought that it will also knock our doors
                                  in such a short span of time, Our entire social and economic
                                  life came to stand still when government of India declared
                                                         th
                                  complete lock down on 20 March 2020.
                                    Entire country was battling with how to deal with lockdown
                                  as well as how to keep away corona virus catching them and
                                  their dear ones. In quick span of time all private activities were
                                  stopped, trains were cancelled, schools were shut and essential
                                  services were running at minimum and at restricted level.
                                  People were forced to stay where they are with no proper
                                  information how long it will go on continuing.
                                    In all these crises one area underwent complete reshaping
                                  and it was ‘Education Sector’. educational sector were not sure
                                  when would reopen to normal activities of admission, exams
                                  and teaching-learning. The future of education for 200 million
                                  odd children who were totally depended on our education
                                  system got uninterrupted. Suddenly entire education system
                                  started turning towards digital learning sources and stared
                                  exploring its potentiality as a future mode of instruction.

                                    Digitalization of teaching and learning is not a new one.
                                  Entire education system is aware of it and it’s a part and parcel
                                  of the delivery process in some way other.
                                    But current condition has compelled us to switch to online
                                  mode all of sudden. Our country where poverty and hunger are
                                  still a big issue, we are still struggling to bring all our young
                                  population under school, children do not have access to even
                                  proper school although. In such situation how digital learning
                                  can be used ? It was because connectivity and bandwidth as
                                  well understanding level of digital education is very low in our
                                  country.
                                    Covid 19 crises has forced us to re-innovate our entire
                                  education system but this should be done with caution and

                                  that’s without the human touch in teaching and learning although
                                  in today’s world teacher is not just an instructor but he is
                                  friend, guide, mentor, mother and father to students. This
                                  aspect of teaching has been properly considered before
                                  overzealously pushing for digitalization.

                                    l Digital and online education gives teacher an opportunity
                                       to design the course content as per need of the student
                                       whom they are catering.
                                    l Greater flexibility for both teacher and student to use the
                                       source as per their convenience.
                                    l Beneficial for both slow learners who can see the
                                       content over and over again to understand the points as
                                       well as a smart student can use it as an additional help.

                                    B. To study the challenges of digitalization of education
                                    l The course contents are very discreet and only can be
                                       used by those who are wealthy.
                                    l Digital tools are still at experimental basis and hence still
                                       it does not come under regulation of anybody in
                                       comparison to normal education system. So, it’s difficult
                                       to check the validity of the material used and content
                                       delivered.

                                    l As digital learning depends on tools like computer,
                                       laptop, iPod or Smart phone then it means that it will be
                                       accessible to few privileged class.
                                    l Digital class rooms and teaching learning mechanism
                                       could not do much in  case  of reluctant learner  but  a
                                       good teacher can motivate  student to take active interest
                                       in teaching and learning,

                                    l Digital education cannot replace the need of human
                                       touch in education as teacher not only teach but also
                                       inculcate values, ethics and humanity in their students
                                       but digital tools will surely miss this crucial aspect.

                                    l Implementing digital learning in India will be upheaval
                                       task because of lack of infrastructure like proper
                                       electricity, Internet connectivity, etc.

                                    l Lack of enough investment in education by government
                                       can be a big challenge as digitalization means heavy
                                       expenditure in infrastructure and training of staff.
                                    C. To suggest the measure to overcome the challenges

                                    Conclusion

                                    Digital education is a future of education system, but it is
                                  still at evolving stage. There is need for a proper body at high
                                  ministerial level. The task force can be a good mix of
                                  bureaucrats, educationists, school owners and Policy Makers
                                  from across states chaired and led by the MHRD Minister. This
                                  task force should quickly draw up guidelines for dissemination
                                  of education with this mode to bring quality and uniformity.
                                    The need of hour is that  instead of pushing students to
                                  learn computer and other skills; emphasis must be given on
                                  exploring creativity of student and making learning an enjoyable
                                  process.
